# Submitting an issue to the BBT bug tracker

* Please verify that you are on the latest release of BBT.
* If you wish to report a combination of feature requests, bug reports and general usage questions, please file a separate report for each of these. It is easier for me to manage them separately. Thank you.
* Please use a descriptive subject for the issue you are experiencing, and describe what you've done. "It doesn't work" is not enough information for me to know what's going on.
* Make yourself available for follow-up questions and testing. If my test suite hasn't picked it out, it's something that is particular to your system/references. I need the feedback so I can help you.
* DO NOT CLOSE ISSUES unless you've opened it by accident. After the problem is resolved I need to still make sure the fix gets into the release, and open issues remind me of that.

# Bug classification

## Exporting references

If your bug report/feature request/question concerns problems with exporting references, please specify whether you're exporting BibTeX or BibLaTeX. Please right-click the references where you experience the export problem, select "Send Better BibTeX Error", and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

## Non-export problems with BBT

If your issue is a bug report, but not for exports, restart Zotero with debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled), reproduce your problem, and select "Report Better BibTeX error" from the help menu, and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.
