# Bug classification

## Exporting references

If your bug report/feature request/question concerns problems with exporting references, please specify whether you're exporting BibTeX or BibLaTeX. Please right-click the references where you experience the export problem, select "Send Better BibTeX Error", and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

## Non-export problems with BBT

If your issue is a bug report, but not for exports, restart Zotero with debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled), reproduce your problem, and select "Report Better BibTeX error" from the help menu, and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.
