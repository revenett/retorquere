<!--
REGARDING ZOTERO 5: I am aware that the latest BBT release does not work in Zotero 5. Please see issue #555

DO NOT OPEN NEW ISSUES about Z5 compatibility, but add your comments on #555. Thank you. The current state of affairs
can be found at https://trello.com/b/OpJQyVTP/better-bibtex-for-zotero-5

If your bug report/feature request/question concerns problems with
exporting references, please specify whether you're exporting BibTeX
or BibLaTeX.

If your issue is about exports of any kind, please right-click the
references where you experience the export problem, select "Send Better
BibTeX Error", and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you
submit) here.

If your issue is a bug report, but not for exports, restart Zotero with
debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled),
reproduce your problem, and select "Report Better BibTeX error"
from the BBT preferences in the Advanced pane, and post the resulting
report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

If you wish to report a combination of feature requests, bug reports
and general usage questions, please file a separate report for each of
these. It is easier for me to manage them separately. Thank you.
