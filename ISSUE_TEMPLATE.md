# Bug classification

## Exporting references

If your bug report/feature request/question concerns problems with exporting references, please specify whether you're exporting BibTeX or BibLaTeX. Please right-click the references where you experience the export problem, select "Send Better BibTeX Error", and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

## Non-export problems with BBT

If your issue is a bug report, but not for exports, restart Zotero with debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled), reproduce your problem, and select "Report Better BibTeX error" from the help menu, and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

## Support

I want to make it abundently clear that you are in no way obliged to pay anything for BBT, and I hate asking for money for BBT, but the time has come: my MacBook Air is not really hacking it anymore, and in order to do decent cross-platform support, a MacBook is what I need. [Anything you can spare](https://www.paypal.me/retorquere) towards that goal is very much appreciated. Currently at 24% of target.
