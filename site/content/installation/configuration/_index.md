The Better BibTeX Configuration can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab 'Better BibTeX'.

The configuration of Better BibTeX is a little baroque compared to the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters (which only have hidden preferences). The defaults should just work, but here's an attempt to describe what they do.

**Making any change here will drop your entire export cache.** This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved [here]({{< ref "performance" >}}).
