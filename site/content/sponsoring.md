title: Sponsoring BBT
---
{warning}


While the development needs of BBT are to a large extent covered by the use of services such as github and travis, my development system does require the occasional upgrade.
My trusty MacBook Air is not really hacking it anymore, and in order to do decent cross-platform support, a MacBook (or a system capable of running macOS in VMware player) is what I need. [Anything you can spare](https://www.paypal.me/retorquere)  towards making that upgrade a reality is very much appreciated. If you'd rather contribute a little bit each month (and a little means a lot) so I can save up for a replacement a year or so down the line, head on over to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/retorquere). Many, many thanks, also to the existing contributors -- thanks to you I've hit my first target and have been able to replace my trusty `manchineel` with `limonia` which has much more breathing room.
