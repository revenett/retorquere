title: Sponsoring BBT

While the development needs of BBT are to a large extent covered
by the generosity towards open-source developers of services such
as github, my development system does require the
occasional upgrade; also, I enjoy getting the occasional frivolous
tech-toy that I wouldn't otherwise grant myself. While you should
feel in no way obligated to pay for BBT, [anything you can spare](https://www.paypal.me/retorquere) is very much appreciated.
If you'd rather contribute a little bit each month (and a little
means a lot) so I can save up for a replacement a year or so down
the line, head on over to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/retorquere),
but mind that Patreon takes a fairly large cut of what you give.

Many, many thanks, also to the existing contributors -- thanks to you I've hit my first target and have been able to replace my trusty macbook air with a newer macbook pro which has much more breathing room.
