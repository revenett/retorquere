#### Citation key format

default: `â€‹[auth:lower][shorttitle3_3][year]`

Set the pattern used to generate citation keys. The format of the keys is documented [here]({{ ref . "citing" }}).

#### Force citation key to plain text

default: `yes`

If you have deviated from the default citation key format pattern by [specifying your own]({{ ref . "citing" }}), you may wind up with non-ASCII characters in your citation keys. You can prevent that using the `fold` function at the appropriate place in your pattern, but checking this checkbox will just apply `fold` to all your keys.

#### Enable citation key search

default: `yes`

Enable searching on citation keys. Slows down startup on very large libraries. Requires Zotero restart to enable/disable.

### Keeping citation keys unique

#### Keep keys unique

default: `within each library`

Auto-generated (non-pinned) keys automatically get a postfix when they would generate a duplicate. By default, the check for duplicates is restricted to the library/group the item lives in. When set to global, the check will include all libraries/groups, so auto-generated keys would be globally unique. Changing this setting *does not* affect existign keys - for this you would need to select the items and refresh the keys.

Options:

* across all libraries
* within each library

#### On conflict with a pinned key, non-pinned keys will be

default: `kept (causes key duplicates)`

This determines what happens if you pin a key to a value that is already in use in a different reference but not pinned there. Neither are ideal, you just get to pick your poison. If you let BBT change the non-pinned key by adding a postfix character, the citation key changes which could be problematic for existing papers. If you keep the non-pinned key as-is, your library now has duplicate keys.

Options:

* postfixed (causes key changes)
* kept (causes key duplicates)
