{{ "#### ascii\n\nIf you have unicode turned on you can still selectively replace some characters to plain-text commands; any characters entered here will always\nbe replaced by their LaTeX-command counterparts.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### autoExportDelay\n\nIf you have auto-exports set up, BBT will wait this many seconds before actually kicking off the exports to buffer multiple changes in quick succession\nsetting off an unreasonable number of auto-exports. Minimum is 1 second. Changes to this preference take effect after restarting Zotero.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### autoExportIdleWait\n\nNumber of seconds to wait after your system goes idle before kicking off auto-exports.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### autoExportPrimeExportCacheBatch\n\nIf cache priming is kicked off (see `autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold`), the cache will be primed in batches of `autoExportPrimeExportCacheBatch`.\nThe lower this number is, the longer the priming will take (there's a fixed per-prime overhead), but (since the priming uses exports under the hood)\nthe larger it is, the longer the priming actions will lock the UI.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### autoExportPrimeExportCacheDelay\n\nCache priming (see `autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold`), happens in a tight loop, which will still make Zotero sluggish while the priming runs.\nBy default, BBT will wait a tenths of a second between prime batches; longer waits mean a more responsive Zotero during the priming,\nbut the priming will take longer to complete.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold\n\nIf an auto-export is triggered and there are more than `autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold` un-cached entries,\nprime the cache before starting the auto-export. This makes the export take longer in total, but since exports\nin Zotero lock up the UI, priming helps making the actual export run as fast as possible. Really only\nuseful for large exports, but what counts as large is system-dependent, so you can play with this value. The\ndefault of `0` disables priming. This is a temporary measure until https://groups.google.com/d/msg/zotero-dev/lHYEtdgPHCE/nDUyxpFmAgAJ\nis implemented in Zotero.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### autoPin\n\nWhen on, BBT will automatically pin the first citekey it generates for an item.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### biblatexExtendedDateFormat\n\nSupport for EDTF dates in biblatex\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### cacheFlushInterval\n\nHow often the Better BibTeX database should be saved to disk. Defaults to once every 5 seconds. Note that\nyour database is always saved when your computer goes idle, or when you exit Zotero.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### citeprocNoteCitekey\n\nReplaces the \"note\" field with the bibtex key during citation rendering in Word/Libreoffice. Main use-case is to help migrating word documents to pandoc.\nThis setting only takes effect during startup, so if you change it, you will have to restart Zotero to have this take effect (or to disable it.\nPlease disable it when done). You will want to use a custom CSL style\n(such as [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/master/better-bibtex-citekeys.csl)) to make this work.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### client\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### csquotes\n\nif you set `csquotes` to a string of character pairs, each pair will be assumed to be the open and close parts of a pair and\nwill be replaced with a `\\\\enquote{...}` construct.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### debugLogDir\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### git\n\nCan be `off`, `config` or `always`\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### ignorePostscriptErrors\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### itemObserverDelay\n\nI've had reports where Zotero notifies extensions that references have changed, but if BBT then actually\nretrieves those same references, Zotero complains they \"haven't been saved yet\". Super. This preference sets\nthe number of microseconds BBT should wait after being notified before acting on the changed references.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### kuroshiro\n\nWhen on, BBT will load kuroshiro for romajization in citekeys. This uses a lot of memory, easily 100MB. If you don't have Japanese titles/names, keep this off.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### mapMath\n\nAny characters entered here will prefer a math-mode LaTeX-command counterpart over a math-mode,\nif a math-mode command is available. Only useful when `mapUnicode` is `conservative`.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### mapText\n\nAny characters entered here will prefer a text-mode LaTeX-command counterpart over a math-mode, if a text-mode command is available.\nOnly useful when `mapUnicode` is `conservative`. Characters specified in `mapMath` take presedence over characters specified in `mapText`.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### mapUnicode\n\nWhen a unicode character can be exported as either a math-mode or text-mode command, map to:\n\n* `conservative`: if both a math-mode and a text-mode mapping is available, stay in the mode of the previously mapped\n   character if possible. This minimizes the number of generated `$`s in the output.\n* `text`: if both a math-mode and a text-mode mapping is available, prefer text.\n* `math`: if both a math-mode and a text-mode mapping is available, prefer math.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### newTranslatorsAskRestart\n\nNew translators installed in Zotero are not immediately usuable for drag-and-drop. If you want to use BBT for drag-and-drop\n(e.g. to drag and drop citekeys or citations), you will be asked whether you want to restart after installation,\nor whether you want to reinstall when it is more convenient to you. You will be asked this whenever the BBT translators update,\nbut you can disable this by checking \"Do not ask again\" in that dialog.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### parseParticles\n\nName particle handling. Only turn on when requested and we're talking about it on github.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### platform\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### rawLaTag\n\nWhen an item has this tag, all its fields will be assumed to hold raw LaTeX and will undergo no further transformation.\nIf you set this to `*`, all items will be assumed to have raw LaTeX.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### relativeFilePaths\n\nWhen exporting a Bib(La)TeX file, if the attachments are stored anywhere under the directory the bibliography is exported to, use relative paths\nto those attachments. Caching is disabled when this option is on, so it affects performance.\n\n" | markdownify }}

{{ "#### suppressNoCase\n\nOn import, BBT will add case-protection (<span class=\"nocase\">...<span>) to titles that have words in {Braces}. There's plenty of bib(la)tex files\nout there that do this a little overzealously, and you may not like the resulting HTML code in your items, even though this is what the braces mean in bib(la)tex, and\nZotero supports it. If you turn this off, the markup is omitted during import.\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### suppressSentenceCase\n\nBib(La)TeX references ought to be stored in Title Case; Zotero references are expected to be entered as sentence-case. With this option on, BBT will try to sentence-case\nduring import. This sentence-casing uses heuristics, no natural language processing is performed, and the results are not perfect. You can suppress this, but you may then also want\nto enable suppressTitleCase (which has its own problems, see the help entry for that option on this page).\n\n" | markdownify }}
{{ "#### suppressTitleCase\n\nIf you're dead-set on ignoring both BibTeX/BibLaTeX best practice and the Zotero recommendations on title/sentence\ncasing, set this preference to `true` to suppress [title casing for English references]({{ ref . \"support/faq#bbt-is-changing-the-capitalization-of-my-titles-why\" }}).\n\n" | markdownify }}
