      "abstractNote": "The purpose of this paper is to suggest that models in scientific practice can be conceived of as epistemic artefacts. Approaching models this way accommodates many such things that working scientists themselves call models but which the semantic conception of models does not duly recognize as such. That models are epistemic artefacts implies, firstly, that they cannot be understood apart from purposeful human activity. Secondly, it implies that they are somehow materialized inhabitants of the intersubjective field of human activity. Thirdly, it implies that models can function also as knowledge objects. We argue that models as epistemic artefacts give knowledge in many other ways than just via direct representative links. To substantiate our view we use an example of a language-technological artefact, a parser.",

The essays in this volume\u2013intriguing, challenging, and often baffling to the reader\u2013call him always to abandon all superficial scanning and to enter wholeheartedly into the serious pursuit of thinking....</P><P>\"Heidegger is not a 'primitive' or a 'romanitic.' He is not one who seeks escape from the burdens and responsibilities of contemporary life into serenity, either through the re-creating of some idyllic past or through the exalting of some simple experience. Finally, Heidegger is not a foe of technology and science. He neither disdains nor rejects them as though they were only destructive of human life.</P><P>\"The roots of Heidegger's hinking lie deep in the Western philosophical tradition. Yet that thinking is unique in many of its aspects, in its language, and in its leterary expression. In the development of this thought Heidegger has been taught chiefly by the Greeks, by German idealism, by phenomenology, and by the scholastic theological tradition. In him these and other elements have been fused by his genius of sensitivity and intellect into a very individual philosophical expression.\" \u2013William Lovitt, <I>from the Introduction</I>",

      "abstractNote": "This article extends and develops a theory I began in my book, The Construction of Social Reality. Its aim is to explore social ontology in a way that will make it clear that social ontology is both created by human actions and attitudes but at the same time has an epistemically objective existence and is part of the natural world. The fundamental concepts necessary to explain its creation and continued existence are: the distinction between observer-relative and observer-independent phenomena, the distinction between the epistemic and the ontological senses of the objective\u2013subjective distinction, the notions of collective intentionality, the assignment of function, and constitutive rules. The upshot of the discussion is that the basic notion in institutional ontology is that of a status function. Status functions are the glue that holds society together because they create deontic powers, powers that work by creating desire-independent reasons for action. Thus, social ontology locks into human rationality. I discuss some of the implications of this work for sociology and anthropology.",

It is argued that we should interpret the linguistic turn as a methodological suggestion for how philosophy can take a non-foundational perspective on normativity. It is then argued that although Rorty did not succeed in explicating normativity without foundations (or authority without authoritarianism), we should take seriously the ambition motivating his project. But taking that ambition seriously may require reconsidering the linguistic turn.",

Though both eschewed metaphysics of the traditional apriori sort, and both were intent on making the investigation of science the center of philosophy, they disagreed about how to do so. Part of the disagreement involved the nature of ontological disputes. The central documents in the debate are: (i) Quines 1948 article, On What There Is,textquotedblright which tells us how to discern ontological..",

      "abstractNote": "Internalism and Epistemology is a powerful articulation and defense of a classical answer to an enduring question: What is the nature of rational belief? In opposition to prevailing philosophical fashion, the book argues that epistemic externalism leads, not just to skepticism, but to epistemic nihilism - the denial of the very possibility of justification. And it defends a subtle and sophisticated internalism against criticisms that have widely but mistakenly been thought to be decisive. Beginning with an internalist response to the Gettier problem, the authors deal with the problem of the connection to truth, stressing the distinction between success and rationality as critical to its resolution. They develop a metaregress argument against externalism that has devastating consequences for any view according to which epistemic principles are contingent. The same argument does not, they argue, affect the version of internalism they espouse, since its epistemic principles are analytic and knowable a priori. The final chapter addresses the problem of induction and shows that its solution turns critically on the distinction between success and rationality - the very distinction that lies at the heart of the dispute between internalists and externalists. Provocative, probing, and deliberately unfashionable, Internalism and Epistemology is a ringing defense of internalism that will interest specialists and students alike. It is essential reading for anyone who suspects that rumors of the death of traditional epistemology have been greatly exaggerated.",

The article distinguishes and analyzes three types of \"cyborg intentionality,\" which all involve specific blends of the human and the technological. Technologically mediated intentionality occurs when human intentionality takes place \"through\" technological artifacts; hybrid intentionality occurs when the technological actually merges with the human; and composite intentionality is the addition of human intentionality and the intentionality of technological artifacts.",

      "abstractNote": "In the period from 1300 to 1600 three strata of intellectual activity must be distinguished: university scholars, humanists, and artisans. Both university scholars and humanists were rationally trained. Their methods, however, were determined by their professional conditions and differed substantially from the methods of science. Both professors and humanistic literati distinguished liberal from mechanical arts and despised manual labor, experimentation, and dissection. Craftsmen were the pioneers of causal thinking in this period. Certain groups of superior manual laborers (artist-engineers, surgeons, the makers of nautical and musical instruments, surveyors, navigators, gunners) experimented, dissected, and used quantitative methods. The measuring instruments of the navigators, surveyors, and gunners were the forerunners of the later physical instruments. The craftsmen, however, lacked methodical intellectual training. Thus the two components of the scientific method were separated by the social barrier: logical training was reserved for upper-class scholars; experimentation, causal interest, and quantitative method were left to more or less plebeian artisans. Science was born when, with the progress of technology, the experimental method eventually overcame the social prejudice against manual labor and was adopted by rationally trained scholars. This was accomplished about 1600 (Gilbert, Galileo, Bacon). At the same time the scholastic method of disputation and the humanistic ideal of individual glory were superseded by the ideals of control of nature and advancement of learning through scientific co-operation. In a somewhat different way, sociologically, modern astronomy developed. The whole process was imbedded in the advance of early capitalistic society, which weakened collective-mindedness, magical thinking, and belief in authority and which furthered worldly, causal, rational, and quantitative thinking.",

      "abstractNote": "The idea of a private language was made famous in philosophy by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who in \u00a7243 of his book Philosophical Investigations explained it thus: \u201cThe words of this language are to refer to what can be known only to the speaker; to his immediate, private, sensations. So another cannot understand the  language.\u201d[1] This is not intended to cover (easily imaginable) cases of recordingone's experiences in a personal code, for such a code, however obscurein fact, could in principle be deciphered. What Wittgenstein had inmind is a language conceived as necessarily comprehensibleonly to its single originator because the things which define itsvocabulary are necessarily inaccessible to others. , \u201cBut in a fairy tale the pot too can see and hear!\u201d (Certainly; but it can also talk.), In a logically perfect language, there will be one word and no more for every simple object, and everything that is not simple will be expressed by a combination of words, by a combination derived, of course, from the words for the simple things that enter in, one word for each simple component. A language of that sort will be completely analytic, and will show at a glance the logical structure of the facts asserted or denied. \u2026 A logically perfect language, if it could be constructed, would not only be intolerably prolix, but, as regards its vocabulary, would be very largely private to one speaker. That is to say, all the names that it would use would be private to that speaker and could not enter into the language of another speaker., Many philosophers have taken \u2018I remember the connection right\u2019 to mean \u2018I use \u201cS\u201d when and only when I really have S\u2019. They then take Wittgenstein's argument to be based on scepticism about memory: how can you be sure that you have remembered aright when next you call a sensation \u2018S\u2019? \u2026",

The graph of Fig. 1 and the examples drawn from science in various lands should have made them clear. It may be in order, however, to reiterate that there is nothing about the phases of my model that is cosmically or metaphysically necessary. I am satisfied if my attempt will interest others to go beyond my crude analysis and make a systematic investigation of the diffusion of Western science throughout the world.Such an investigation would include a comparative appraisal of the development of science in different national, cultural, and social settings and would mark the beginnings of truly comparative studies in the history and sociology of science. The present lack of comparative studies in these disciplines can be attributed to the widespread belief that science is strictly an international endeavor. In one sense this is true.As Sir Isaac Newton remarked in his Principia (49), \"the descent of stones in Europe and in America\" must both be explained by one set of physical laws. Yet, we cannot ignore the peculiar environment in which members of a national group of scientists are trained and carry on their research.While I do not hold with the Nazi theorists that science is a direct reflection of the racial or national spirit (50), neither do I accept Chekhov's dictum (51) that \"there is no national science just as there is no national multiplication table. . . .\" In emphasizing the international nature of scientific inquiry we have forgotten that science exists in a local social setting. If that setting does not decisively mold the conceptual growth of science, it can at least affect the number and types of individuals who are free to participate in the internal development of science. Perhaps the effect is more profound; only future scholarship can determine the depth of its influence.",

      "abstractNote": "In the first part of his career Wittgenstein was a logician of first rank, along with Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. His first book, the 'Tractatus Logico-philosophicus', not only incorporated and deepened the new symbolic logic that was due primarily to Frege and Russell but also developed new tools for the clarification of thought by means of logical analysis. Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, along with G. E. Moore, are the pillars of the \"linguistic turn\" in philosophy. Wittgenstein, however, came to disagree with the other three in fundamental ways, and the divergence resulted in (or perhaps consisted in) pushing epistemology into the back seat. In this paper I will largely ignore the first part of Wittgenstein's career in order to concentrate on how his later work contrasts with both \"ordinary language philosophy\" and mainline academic philosophy.",

      "abstractNote": "Verlagsinfo (vgl. http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/freedom/): Free as in Freedom interweaves biographical snapshots of GNU project founder Richard Stallman with the political, social and economic history of the free software movement. It examines Stallman.s unique personality and how that personality has been at turns a driving force and a drawback in terms of the movement.s overall success. Free as in Freedom examines one man.s 20-year attempt to codify and communicate the ethics of 1970s era .hacking. culture in such a way that later generations might easily share and build upon the knowledge of their computing forebears. The book documents Stallman.s personal evolution from teenage misfit to prescient adult hacker to political leader and examines how that evolution has shaped the free software movement. Like Alan Greenspan in the financial sector, Richard Stallman has assumed the role of tribal elder within the hacking community, a community that bills itself as anarchic and averse to central leadership or authority. How did this paradox come about? Free as in Freedom provides an answer. It also looks at how the latest twists and turns in the software marketplace have diminished Stallman.s leadership role in some areas while augmenting it in others. Finally, Free as in Freedom examines both Stallman and the free software movement from historical viewpoint. Will future generations see Stallman as a genius or crackpot? The answer to that question depends partly on which side of the free software debate the reader currently stands and partly upon the reader.s own outlook for the future. 100 years from now, when terms such as .computer,. .operating system. and perhaps even .software. itself seem hopelessly quaint, will Richard Stallman.s particular vision of freedom still resonate, or will it have taken its place alongside other utopian concepts on the .ash-heap of history?.",

Embryos were biopsied and analysed on day 3, cultured in sequential media, and then transferred on day 4 or day 5 after morphological selection of the best embryos. From a total of 42 cycles started, we achieved 14 clinical pregnancies and have had nine live births so far with five ongoing pregnancies. This is the first report of the use of preimplantation sex selection for family balancing in India, where couples place a premium on having baby boys, and the social and ethical aspects of the use of this technology in this setting are discussed.",

By elaborating a postphenomenological analysis of the mediating role of ultrasound in moral decisions about abortion, the article argues that technologies embody morality and help to constitute moral subjectivity. This technological mediation of the moral subject is subsequently addressed in terms of Michel Foucault?s ethical position, in which ethics is about actively co-shaping one?s moral subjectivity. Integrating Foucauldian ethics and postphenomenology, the article argues that the technological mediation of moral subjectivity should be at the heart of an ethical approach that takes the moral dimensions of technology seriously.",

      "abstractNote": "The European exploration of the Pacific Ocean in the latter half of the eighteenth century is usually presented as part of the Enlightenment's quest for pure knowledge, knowledge which was shared freely in the \"Republic of Letters\". In this essay, however, these expeditions are set against the background of a ferocious struggle between western European states to dominate the world, bringing together national political, commercial, military, and learned institutions, showing them to be more akin to today's \"big science\" than to an activity of free-minded, autonomous, gentlemen. The holistic approach developed to apprehend \"big science\" in today's world is thus used to reexamine scientific cooperation as well as the circulation of men, objects, texts (including maps) and ideas in the politico-economic context of early modern Britain, France and Holland, the relationship between this \"big science\" and eighteenth-century, western European society, and how these shaped European scientific culture and identity. The paper ends with some reflections on the contrast between \"big scientific\" activity in the two periods.",

      "abstractNote": "The best-selling first edition of Law 101 provided readers with a vividly written and indispensable portrait of our nation's legal system. Now, in this revised edition, Jay M. Feinman offers an updated survey of American law, spiced with new anecdotes and cases, and incorporating fresh material on topics ranging from the President's war powers, to intellectual property, standard form contracts, and eminent domain.  Here is an exceptionally clear introduction to law, covering the main subjects found in the first year of law school, giving us a basic understanding of how it all works. Readers are introduced to every aspect of the legal system, from constitutional law and the litigation process to tort law, contract law, property law, and criminal law. Feinman illuminates each discussion with many intriguing, outrageous, and infamous cases, from the scalding coffee case that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, to the sensational murder trial in Victorian London that led to the legal definition of insanity, to the epochal decision in Marbury v. Madison that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal laws unconstitutional. He broadens the reader's legal vocabulary, clarifying the meaning of everything from \"due process\" and \"equal protection\" in constitutional law, to the distinction between \"murder\" and \"manslaughter\" in criminal law. Perhaps most important, we learn that though the law is voluminous and complex, it is accessible to all.  Everyone who wants a better grasp of current legal issues--from students contemplating law school, to journalists covering the legislature or the courts, to fans of Court TV--will find here a wonderful source of information: a complete, clear, and colorful map of the American legal system.   \"An entertaining and informative introduction to the law.... For journalists, those interested in the law, and fans of television law dramas, this book should be required reading.\"--Library Journal",

The assumption, however, becomes increasingly hard to sustain as we gain more familiarity with Kant\u2019s ethical writings and better understanding of his ethical theory.[ii] As for the concept of the good will, Kant does avow the intention of \u201cdeveloping\u201d it (Ak 4:397), and he goes on to thematize concepts that he thinks of as related to the good will (the moral worth of an action, acting from duty). But he never provides an explicit account of what he takes a \u2018good will\u2019 to be.[iii].",

By elaborating a postphenomenological analysis of the mediating role of ultrasound in moral decisions about abortion, the article argues that technologies embody morality, and help to constitute moral subjectivity. This technological mediation of the moral subject is subsequently addressed in terms of Michel Foucault?s ethical position, in which ethics is about actively co?shaping one?s moral subjectivity. Integrating Foucauldian ethics and postphenomenology, the article argues that the technologicalmediation ofmoral subjectivity should be at the heart of an ethical approach that takes the moral dimensions of technology seriously.",
