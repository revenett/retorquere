      "abstractNote": "Cluster model calculations have been carried out to study the electronic state and the chemical bonding in Cu2O and CuO as well as YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu3O6. The clusters used are Cu4O14-9, Cu4O16-12, Cu3O17-12 and Cu3O15-10, respectively, each being embedded in an appropriate electrostatic potential reflecting the crystal structure. The covalent interaction between Cu and O is most significant in the cluster for the high-temperature superconductor YBa2CuO7. It is remarkable that O 2p[pi] holes are created near the Fermi level and stabilized in the O----Cu+---O- linear bond formed in the basal Cu2O plane of the cluster for YBa2Cu3O7. A charge disproportionation takes place both in the model clusters for YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu3O6, while a spin polarization is seen only in the latter. The similarity and dissimilarity of Cu atoms in those oxides are discussed.",

The group-theoretical analysis of electric field effect on transitions with different orbital quantum numbers l makes it possible to reveal the P-, S-, and D-series of exciton levels on the basis of experimental data. The position of dipole-active and -inactive levels has been determined by extrapolation to zero field, which enables one to study the l-splitting in a cubic crystal. With the l-splitting, the P-series remains exactly hydrogen-like, the D-series preserves an approximate hydrogen-like behaviour, and the S-series looses its hydrogen-like behaviour.",

      "abstractNote": "In this study, electrochromic properties of cuprous oxide nanoparticles, self-accumulated on the surface of a sol-gel silica thin film, have been investigated by using UV-visible spectrophotometry in a lithium-based electrolyte cell. The cuprous oxide nanoparticles showed a reversible electrochromic process with a thin film transmission reduction of about 50% in a narrow wavelength range of 400-500\u00c2\u00a0nm, as compared to the bleached state of the film. Using optical transmission measurement, we have found that the band gap energy of the films reduced from 2.7\u00c2\u00a0eV for Cu2O to 1.3\u00c2\u00a0eV for CuO by increasing the annealing temperature from 220 to 300\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C in an N2 environment for 1\u00c2\u00a0h. Study of the band gaps of the as-deposited, colored and bleached states of the nanoparticles showed that the electrochromic process corresponded to a reversible red-ox conversion of Cu2O to CuO on the film surface, in addition to the reversible red-ox reaction of the Cu2O film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the copper oxide nanoparticles accumulated on the film surface, after annealing the samples at 200\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C. Surface morphology of the films and particle size of the surface copper oxides have also been studied by atomic force microscopy analysis. The copper oxide nanoparticles with average size of about 100\u00c2\u00a0nm increased the surface area ratio and surface roughness of the silica films from 2.2% and 0.8\u00c2\u00a0nm to 51% and 21\u00c2\u00a0nm, respectively.",

The substrates were either unheated or heated to a temperature of 300\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C. The films were also annealed in air at a temperature of 500\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C for 3\u00c2\u00a0h. The films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and UV-visible spectrophotometry. The effects of the substrate temperature and post-deposition annealing on the chemical, structural and optical properties of the films were investigated. As-deposited films on unheated substrates consisted of mixed cupric oxide (CuO) and Cu2O phases, with a higher concentration of the Cu2O phase. However, the films deposited on heated substrates and the annealed films were predominantly of the CuO phase.",

      "abstractNote": "First-principles density functional theory and a periodic-slab model have been utilized to investigate the adsorption of a 2-chlorophenol molecule on a CuO(1\ufffd1\ufffd1) surface with a vacant Cu surface site, namely Cu2O(1\ufffd1\ufffd1)-CuCUS. Several vertical and flat orientations have been studied. All of these molecular configurations interact very weakly with the Cu2O(1\ufffd1\ufffd1)-CuCUS surface, an observation which also holds for clean copper surfaces and the Cu2O(1\ufffd1\ufffd0):CuO surface. Hydroxyl-bond dissociation assisted by the surface was found to be endoergic by 0.42-1.72\ufffdeV, depending predominantly on the position of the isolated H on the surface. In addition, the corresponding adsorbed 2-chlorophenoxy moiety was found to be more stable than a vacuum 2-chlorophenoxy radical by about 0.76\ufffdeV. Despite these predicted endoergicities, however, we would predict the formation of 2-chlorophenoxy radicals from gaseous 2-chlorophenol over the copper (I) oxide Cu2O(1\ufffd1\ufffd1)-CuCUS surface to be a feasible and important process in the formation of PCDD/Fs in the post-flame region where gas-phase routes are negligible.",

For nanomaterials with smaller particles, the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 was shown to increase with a decrease in temperature T &lt; T N. The increase in \u03c7 in both series of samples is related to the disordering of Cu2+ spins at the surfaces of nanoparticles. The magnetic properties of nanopowders characterize the properties of isolated nanoparticles. In a dense nanoceramic, the size effect is compensated for by the interaction between nanoparticles. The magnetic properties of nanoceramics are determined by elastic stresses induced by an external action. Elastic-stress relaxation results in the recovery of magnetic order and decreases the magnetic susceptibility.",

      "abstractNote": "In this work, the effects of doping on hydrogen sensitivity and sensor response of CuO/ZnO heterocontacts were examined. Both current\u2212voltage and current\u2212time measurements were utilized in hydrogen/air and hydrogen/nitrogen atmospheres at 400 \u00b0C. The addition of Ni to p-type CuO and Ga to n-type ZnO were observed to enhance the sensor properties. Through analysis of the time-dependent current data, it was shown that the sensor response of the heterocontact can be modeled via a two-site Langmuir adsorption model. The response times of the two sites were calculated using this model. While one of the sites showed a significant decrease in response time when the p-side was doped with Ni, the response time of the other site changed only slightly. The highest sensitivity was obtained by doping the n-side with Ga at the expense of the response rate. The fastest response times were achieved when both sides of the heterocontact were doped. This suggests that carrier density may play a significant role in the sensor response.",

      "abstractNote": "The ternary oxides KCuO and K4CuO3 have been observed as products in the solid state reactions of potassium oxide with the oxides Cu2O and CuO under argon and in vacuum. The compound K4CuO3 has been isolated as a single phase and its X-ray powder diffraction pattern has been obtained. Both Cu2O and CuO are reduced by liquid potassium to copper metal, with the formation of the ternary oxides KCuO and K4CuO3. Thermal analysis showed that Cu2O reacts with liquid potassium at 185 \ufffdC and that CuO undergoes the same reaction at 70 \ufffdC.",

Vol- ume weighted average grain size, unit cell expansion, oxygen de\ufb01ciency, and microstrain values as a function of milling time were obtained from XRD. SAXS data revealed different nanostructures for samples synthesized by one-step solid-state reaction (SSR) or HEBM-treated powders. The latter presented the characteristics of a multilayered nano- scale solid system with surface fractal behavior. Correlation of the XRD microstructural parameters and the power law exponent of the SAXS curves as a function of temperature and milling time provided a coherent picture of the structure of HEBM-treated powders. The overall structural informa- tion presented in this article may shed some light on the macroscopic physical properties of CuO nanostructures.",

The nanoparticles show unusual features in comparison to other antiferromagnetic nanoparticle systems. The field cooled (FC) and zero field cooled (ZFC) magnetization curves bifurcate well above the N\u00e9el temperature and the usual peak in the ZFC magnetization curve is absent. The system does not show any memory effects which is in sharp contrast to the usual behavior shown by other antiferromagnetic nanoparticles. It turns out that the non-equilibrium behavior of CuO nanoparticles is very strange and is neither superparamagnetic nor spin glass-like.",

Because two separate processes occur simultaneously, that of Cu2O corrosion and corrosion inhibition by BTA adsorption, the spectral information was subjected to deconvolution by a conjugate gradient minimization algorithm. Under these conditions, a solution phase concentration of 7-10\u00c2\u00a0[mu]M BTA nearly completely inhibited the corrosion of Cu2O in deionized water. Using a Langmuir adsorption model, this represented only 25% of the maximally covered surface area.",

We have extended a recently proposed self-consistent quasiparticle approach, based on the GW approximation, to the calculation of optical spectra, including excitonic effects. The band structure compares favorably with our present angle-resolved photoemission measurements. The excitonic effects based on these realistic band structure and screening provide a reliable optical absorption spectrum, which allows for a revised interpretation of its main structures.",

The data obtained by XPS have been subjected to factor analysis in order to determine the compositional layering of the copper oxides. This leads to two or three relevant components within the oxide layers consisting of Cu2O or CuO dependent on the sample preparation. GDOES measurements show sputtering profiles which are seriously influenced by a varying sputter rate. To ensure the results obtained so far, RBS measurements of the oxide layers have been carried out in order to discover artefacts of the other methods used and to demonstrate the excellent suitability of RBS for quantitative analysis of these layers. Chemical analysis consisting of (1) carrier-gas fusion analysis (CGFA) and (2) selective dissolution of Cu2O/CuO allows the determination of the total amount of oxygen and copper, respectively, and can serve as a cornerstone of quantitative analysis.",

The morphology and structure of Cu2O particles were greatly affected by the concentration of glucose, reaction temperature, and time. When the concentration of glucose increased from 0.6 to 1.6 M, the morphology of Cu2O could be changed from octahedral single crystals to spherical polycrystals. When the reaction time was prolonged from 6 to 36 h, solid Cu2O octahedra could be changed to a mixture of hollow Cu2O octahedra and irregular Cu particles. After removing Cu particles, pure Cu2O hollow octahedra could be obtained. The formation mechanism of hollow Cu2O octahedra was discussed. Similarly, hollow Cu2O spheres could also be obtained using this method. The prepared hollow octahedral Cu2O particles exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity for photodegradation of p-nitrophenol aqueous solution under visible-light illumination than other Cu2O particles with different morphologies (hollow spheres, solid octahedra, and solid spheres).",

Correlations z(pO2) at equilibrium solid[left right double arrow]pure di-oxygen - when they can be computed - indicate the presence of either oxygen vacancies or copper interstitials or clusters of them. Some recent data after quenching are in favor of copper interstitials. Few data concerning tenorite prepared by decomposition of a salt, by oxidation of copper and by CVT in sealed tubes have generally been interpreted in the literature as indicating copper deficiency. In those oxides a large departure from the stoichiometry indicates a complex behavior likely due to several point defects possibly ordering at short and/or long range, and including chemical impurities in the case of sealed tube preparation. It is, however, in fact likely that the defect structure of such samples involves the two sub-lattices. Cu3O2- or Cu4O3-like clusters can even be envisaged.",

      "abstractNote": "Cu2O nanowires were successfully fabricated by a simple liquid reaction in the presence of amphiphilic triblock copolymer (P123). The concentration of copolymer and aging time drastically changed the morphology of Cu2O samples. XPS results show that tiny amount of CuO as well as some absorbed O2 molecules existed on the surface of the Cu2O nanowires. Thermal analysis shows that the triblock copolymer owns a higher decomposition temperature (\u00a0645\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C) than that of pervious research results and this may be the result of strong interaction between P123 and Cu2O. The band gap of Cu2O nanowires was estimated about 2.23\u00c2\u00a0eV and shifting of the band gap with decreasing of the particle size could also be found. The photoluminance property study reveals that the intrinsic emission peak of Cu2O nanowires can be observed at 546\u00c2\u00a0nm under the excitation wavelength of 400\u00c2\u00a0nm (Xe lamp was used as the excitation light source).",

      "abstractNote": "The photoelectrochemical properties of Copper Oxide thin film, prepared by spray pyrolysis on conducting glass (SnO2: F-coated glass) substrate were investigated as a function of film deposition temperature and spray time. The variation in the deposition temperature affected the film morphology. The film deposited at substrate temperature 350\ufffdC exhibited better photoresponse than the films prepared at 300\ufffdC and 400\ufffdC. Creation of large number of dislocations and kink sites at 300\ufffdC and 400\ufffdC, which act as a recombination center for photogenerated electron has been held as a possible cause for poor photoresponse observed. The rise in photocurrent density with increase in spray time has been attributed to the increase in film thickness, which is probably allowing the film to absorb photons more efficiently. X-ray diffraction patterns of films confirm the presence of cupric oxide (CuO) phase. The films of CuO were found of n-type, apparently suggesting the existence of oxygen vacancies in the structure, on account of incomplete oxidation taking place at a relatively low temperatures (300-400\ufffdC).",

The measurements discussed here include the forward I\u2013V characteristics at various temperatures, current vs. thickness relationship at constant voltage, the effect of photo-memory on the I\u2013V characteristics, and the discovery of a negative resistance regime at below room temperature at sufficiently high injection levels. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the current in the ohmic and the regimes, together with the effect of photomemory on the I\u2013V characteristics enable us to identify the regime as the Ashley\u2013Milnes regime with field dependent mobility.",

The zone-folding mechanism in CuO is unusual in that one of the folded phonons hardens significantly in frequency as the sample is further cooled below TN2. It is shown that this dependence on temperature is determined by the sublattice magnetization and that the unusually large shift in frequency is caused by a strong spin-phonon interaction in cupric oxide.",

Field-emission characteristics, including emission-current-applied-field plot and emission site distribution, have been studied using the transparent anode technique. In addition, the temperature dependence of the field-emission characteristics has been studied from room temperature to 750 K. The threshold field for obtaining a current density of 10 \u03bcA/cm2 is ~11 MV/m. This decreases with increasing temperature, and at 700 K it is ~6 MV/m. At a fixed field of 10 MV/m, about a three-orders-of-magnitude increase of the emission current level has been observed. The results show that the cupric oxide nanobelt is a promising candidate for cathode material in a thermoelectric conversion device based on field emission.",

However, when Triton X-100 was replaced with Brij 56 in the microemulsion, hollow Cu2O nanocubes were synthesized. The addition of toluene into the Brij 56 system could decrease the ratio of hollow nanocubes. It was suggested that the balance between the reduction rate of Cu2+ depending on the yield of hydrated electrons (e-aq) and the escape rate of the mixed solvent determined their final morphologies. The presence of EG influenced the rigidity of the interface of the microemulsion and thus the above balance, which resulted in the different morphologies of Cu2O nanoparticles in the Brij 56-based microemulsion.",

      "abstractNote": "Fine powders of micron- and submicron-sized particles of undoped Cu2O semiconductor, with three different sizes and morphologies, have been synthesized by different chemical processes. These samples include nanospheres 200 nm in diameter, octahedra of size 1 \u00b5m and polyhedra of size 800 nm. They exhibit a wide spectrum of magnetic properties. At low temperature, T = 5 K, the octahedron sample is diamagnetic with the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7OH = -9.5 \u00d7 10-6 emu g-1\u00a0Oe-1. The nanosphere is paramagnetic with \u03c7NS = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u20115\u00a0emu\u00a0g\u20111\u00a0Oe\u20111. The other two polyhedron samples synthesized in different runs by the same process are found to show different magnetic properties. One of them exhibits weak ferromagnetism with TC\u00a0455\u00a0K and saturation magnetization MS\u00a00.19\u00a0emu\u00a0g\u20111 at T = 5\u00a0K, while the other is paramagnetic with \u03c7 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u20115\u00a0emu\u00a0g\u20111\u00a0Oe\u20111. The total magnetic moment estimated from the detected impurity concentration of Fe, Co and Ni, is too small to account for the observed magnetism by one to two orders of magnitude. Calculations by density functional theory (DFT) reveal that cation vacancies in the Cu2O lattice are one of the possible causes of induced magnetic moments. The results further predict that the defect-induced magnetic moments favour a ferromagnetically coupled ground state if the local concentration of cation vacancies, nC, exceeds 12.5%. This offers a possible scenario to explain the observed magnetic properties. The limitations of the investigations in the present work, in particular in the theoretical calculations, are discussed and possible areas for further study are suggested.",

The photonic stop band of the composite opal can be observed from the UV\u2013Vis spectrum, which indicates that the Cu2O filled into ZnO inverse opal did not destroy its three-dimensional (3D) ordered structure. Due to the multiple scattering in the 3D ordered structure, the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) are stronger in Cu2O\u2013ZnO composite opal than those in a Cu2O/ZnO bilayer film and a Cu2O/ITO film without 3D ordered structure. The remaining ZnO inverse opal in Cu2O\u2013ZnO composite opal enhances the photoluminescence measured in back geometry while it suppresses that in front geometry.",

The confocal Raman spectrometry results con\ufb01rm the expected outcome, that reducing of the diameter of a cylindrical cross-section of a single nanowire results in Raman frequency downshifts. The results can be explained by the bond polarizability model. The applicability of investigating the size effects of the quantum con\ufb01nement of the tip-like geometry of a single nanowire without any preparation for different sizes of nanoparticles is possible because the detection is relatively straightforward and the reproduced Raman signals can be observed.",

The three Raman active modes predicted by group theory have been identified and their room temperature frequencies determined to be 298, 345 and 632 cm-1. A new mode appears in the spectra (240 cm-1 at 15K) as the sample is cooled below the N\ufffdel Temperature (TN = 225\ufffd 5K of CuO. Based upon its temperature dependence this mode is tentatively assigned to scattering from a low-lying electronic excitation. Another mode (218 cm-1 at 300K) softens and disappears on cooling the sample below 200K. The results are discussed in terms of data obtained from recent neutron and Mossbauer studies on CuO.",

The different series of exciton absorption lines appear in the photoconductivity response curve. However the lines can appear as maxima or as minima of the photoconductivity according to the conditions under which the experiment is carried out. Different properties of the photoconductivity are studied. In particular, a negative effect can be observed with Cu2O. The conditions underwhich these effects are observed have been determined. It is shown that these effects are observed when traps of a special kind are present on the surface of the crystal and on the boundary between grains.",

The electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) is used for in situ phase analysis measurements of the thin films, and the phase composition is determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. The electrochemical parameter limits for the deposition of nanowires are reported.

Stationary analyses exhibit a tenuous decrease of the plateau electrolytic current as the magnetic field increases. Due to the limited diffusion process of the hydroxide species which reacts during the electrochemical process, a magnetically induced effect can be suspected but deposition of Cu2O that covers the electrode and \"passivates\" the surface leads to antagonist effects that explain the current decrease. For a cathodic applied potential corresponding to the current plateau, X-ray diffraction studies reveal the formation of single phase cubic Cu2O films with or without magnetic field, but a change in electrocrystallization kinetics of Cu2O is observed in the presence of the magnetic field. Analyses of the transient current curves reveal a convective effect of the magnetic field from the very first moments of the electrocrystallization.",

The theoretical predictions are verified experimentally by high-resolution absorption experiments. In agreement with theory the fine structure shows a characteristic dependence on the direction of the wave vector. The exchange splitting of the orthoexciton triplet are distinguished from strain-induced perturbations. The exchange gives rise to an isotropic and an anisotropic correction of the effective exciton mass. This can explain the discrepancies in the measurements of the exciton mass in Cu2O .",

      "abstractNote": "The nature of the surface layers grown on copper electrodes in free corrosion conditions in unbuffered aerated Na2SO4 solutions (pH = 3.0-6.0) was investigated by photoelectrochemical methods. The formation of cuprous oxide has been revealed by means of a careful study of the photocurrent spectra obtained in situ. The growth of n-Cu2O has been observed to occur with or without Cu2+ ions in solution in a narrow range of pH around five. More acidic solutions seem to favour the formation of p-Cu2O both in absence as well as in presence of Cu2+ ions in solution ([Cu2+] = 0.05 M). The addition of chloride ions in variable amounts ([Cl-] [less-than-or-equals, slant] 0.1 M) seems to affect mainly the corrosion rate of copper electrodes at low concentrations ([Cl-] [less-than-or-equals, slant] 10-2 M). At higher chloride concentrations changes in the semiconducting properties as well as in the nature of the corrosion layers can occur. The presence of complex transients in the photocurrent vs time plots has been related to the presence of chloride ions in solution.",

Whole Powder Pattern Modelling of the X-ray diffraction patterns shows the presence of a bimodal size distribution in the nanopowders, with a fraction of domains in the 10-40\ufffdnm range and a smaller one below 10\ufffdnm. Linear and planar defects are absent. A relationship between the average size of the larger particles and the quantity of water in the system was obtained. The stability of cuprite under visible light irradiation both during the synthesis and after the preparation was investigated, showing that a self-catalytic conversion of Cu2O into CuO takes place in water.",

The effects of SnO2 insertion on the Cu2O photo-catalytic activity for the degradation of trifluralin were reported here. The results show that SnO2-doping can greatly enhance catalytic activity of Cu2O nano-crystals.",

The tetragonal structure has a distortion of the linear Cu crystal field that represents the structure of a polarized crystal in an electric field. The symmetry of the bands changes in such a way that the dipole forbidden transition of the yellow series excitons in the undistorted cubic structure becomes dipole allowed in the tetragonal structure. The energy of the excitons becomes lower in the polarized crystal. These changes in the band gap properties make it possible to create an exciton trap in thin Cu2O films with a scanning tunneling microscopy tip while the excitons can be resonantly created with a laser via a dipole allowed transition.",

This oxide, which doubtless causes the rapid change in the behaviour of these metals to silver and copper nitrates respectively3, can be estimated by measuring the number of millicoulombs needed for its cathodic reduction. The principle was formerly used to measure silver iodide films4, and gave numbers agreeing with both gravimetric and iodometric methods. For oxide films it has yielded results in reasonable accord with optical5 and gravimetric methods (see accompanying table), and consistent with early chemical determinations made on the films after stripping6. Former disagreement between gravimetric and optical methods has been largely due to neglect of invisible films, or to different meanings attached to the term `thickness' as applied to a non-uniform film on an uneven surface.",

We prepared uniform CuO nanocrystals (7-100 nm) and studied their size-dependent Raman scattering spectra. The relative variation between the two-phonon scattering band (2Bg) and the one-phonon band (Bg) indicates a decreasing electron-phonon coupling with reducing size, which unveils the dominant Fr\u00f6hlich electron-phonon coupling, as indicated by Devreese, but not the small polaron in CuO. Moreover, the anomalous enhancement of the multi-phonon band at a critical size and 1D structure at room temperature is attributable to an enhanced electron-phonon coupling accompanied by phonon-plasmon coupling, i.e., the 'plasphon' proposed by Alexandrov et al in 1981.",

      "abstractNote": "The kinetics of oxidation of copper powders in oxygen and in dry and humid air was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The extent of oxidation grew linearly with time until the weight-based thickness of the oxide film reached 0.13\u20131.22 nm, depending on the temperature. Between 30 and 90\u00b0C there was little difference between the kinetic curves observed in air and in oxygen, respectively. Higher humidity of the air resulted in an increased oxidation rate. Following the initial linear segment, the oxidation kinetics could be best described in terms of a logarithmic rate law between 30 and 45\u00b0C and in terms of a power law between 60 and 90\u00b0C. The activation energy for the initial linear stage was (44\u00b12) kJ and for the subsequent oxidation (102\u00b112) kJ. Delayed increases in oxidation rate were observed with a ca. 0.1-\u00b5m powder around 100\u00b0C, with a ca. 1-\u00b5m powder around 320\u00b0C, and with a < 10\u00b5m powder around 360\u00b0C. A three-stage model consisting of an initial linear stage, parabolic growth culminating in cracking of the oxide film, and subsequent re-start of the parabolic growth, gave good agreement with the experimental data. Whenever the powder is relatively uniform and the distribution of film-cracking times among the powder grains is narrow, e.g., within 23% of the median cracking time, an increase in the oxidation rate of the entire sample can be observed.",

      "abstractNote": "A well cleaned copper plate with a thin Au layer deposited was heated in air to make hole transfer sites with p-Cu 2 O at 800\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min. A transparent NiO layer was prepared on the surface of this device to make electron transfer sites on the surface. This heat-treated device, having 2\u00a0\u00b5m Au layers, exhibited a remarkably stable steady photocurrent and a higher photocurrent quantum efficiency in a KI(10 -2\u00a0M) + I 2 (10 -4\u00a0M) electrolyte solution when a thin transparent 0.05\u00a0\u00b5m NiO layer was deposited on the surface to screen the electrolyte. During the heating of the Au-deposited copper plate at 800\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min, initially an alloy of Cu and Au was produced, then a thin homogeneous p-Cu 2 O film was formed on the alloy by oxidizing the migrated Cu atoms onto the upper surface of the alloy. Characteristics of the samples observed by means of XRD measurements and SEM micrographs, V - I characteristics, photocurrent action spectra, the variations of the photocurrent quantum efficiency with the deposited thickness of NiO and Au layers, photodegradation and improved chemical stability of the p-Cu 2 O photocathode and H 2 evolution from water by the photocathode were investigated to explain the junction effects of the modified p-Cu 2 O with the Cu + Au alloy and NiO transparent film at the electrolyte interface. Here, the NiO layer and Au particles in the Au + Cu alloy efficiently act as the electron-transfer and hole-transfer sites, respectively.",

XRD studies confirmed that the cubic Cu phase of the as-deposited films changes into single cubic Cu2O phase and single monoclinic CuO phase, depending on the annealing conditions. The crystallite size is varied between sim12 and 31\ufffdnm. The lattice parameters of cubic Cu and Cu2O phases are estimated to sim3.60 and sim4.26\ufffd\ufffd, respectively. The films with Cu2O phase showed p-type characteristics. The conductivity is decreased linearly with the decreasing temperature (1/T), which has confirmed the semiconductor nature of the deposited films. The calculated activation energy is varied between 0.10 and 0.16\ufffdeV. The surface microstructure is changed depending on the variation in the annealing temperature. The poor transmittance of the as-deposited films (&lt;1%) is increased to a maximum of sim80% (800\ufffdnm) on annealing at 200\ufffd\ufffdC. The estimated direct allowed band gap is varied between 1.73 and 2.89\ufffdeV.",

Graphs are constructed showing the dependence of the oxide layer thickness (in the 3 \u2013 50 \u03bcm range) on the oxidation parameters such as the temperature, oxygen pressure, and time of oxidation. The solar-cell parameters such as Voc, Vsc and the spectral response are in turn investigated as functions of the oxide layer thickness. The results indicate that cells of possible practical interest will have an oxide layer thickness of the order of 1 \u03bcm, grown at high temperature, high oxygen pressure for oxidation times of less than 1 s.",

We observe that the 3-fold ortho-exciton (\u03935+-symmetry) is not degenerate. For a general k-direction there are three resonances with line width down to 1 \u03bceV. The splitting is quantitatively explained by taking into account the long range and short range exchange interaction. The group velocity of the quadrupole polariton is directly determined with use of 20 ns pulses with still high spectral resolution (\u0394E\u22480.1 \u03bceV). Group velocities down to 4\u00d7104 m/s are quantitatively described by a one-oscillator quadrupole polariton model. The para-exciton (\u03932+-symmetry) is seen in absorption in magnetic fields down to 1 T. In selected crystals it shows a line width of 0.2 \u03bceV.",

The results show that the substrate bias significantly affects the surface morphology, crystalline phases and texture. In the film deposited without bias, two phases\u2014cupric oxide (CuO) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O)\u2014coexist as cross-evidenced by XRD, XPS and Raman analyses, whereas CuO is dominant concurrent with CuO (020) texture in the film deposited with bias.

      "abstractNote": "Semiconducting cuprous oxide films were prepared by electrodeposition onto commercial conducting glass coated with indium tin oxide deposited by spraying technique. The cuprous oxide (Cu2O) films were deposited using a galvanostatic method from an alkaline CuSO4 bath containing lactic acid and sodium hydroxide at a temperature of 60\ufffdC. The film's thickness was about 4-6\ufffd[mu]m. This paper includes discussion for Cu2O films fabrication, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry studies, optical properties and experimental results of solar cells. The values of the open circuit voltage Voc of 340\ufffdmV and the short circuit current density Isc of 245\ufffd[mu]A/cm2 for ITO/Cu2O solar cell were obtained by depositing graphite paste on the rear of the Cu2O layer. It should be stressed that these cells exhibited photovoltaic properties after heat treatment of the films for 3\ufffdh at 130\ufffdC. An electrodeposited layer of Cu2O offers wider possibilites for application and production of low cost cells, both in metal-semiconductor and hetero-junction cell structures, hence the need to improve the photovoltaic properties of the cells.",

      "abstractNote": "The characteristics of solid state devices based on p-type semiconductors with mobile acceptors are discussed. The devices are basic ones of the form: metalsemiconductormetal. The metal electrodes are assumed to be chemically inert and to block material exchange. The effect of the contact potentials as well as of the space charge are taken into consideration. The distribution of charge carriers (holes and acceptors) and the I-V relations are evaluated. These results are compared with those of a model in which the acceptors are immobile and with two approximations in which neutrality is assumed either at the boundary or throughout the whole semiconductor. The motion of the acceptors is found, in some cases, to introduce only minor changes in the I-V relations. This finding may be of significance for solid state devices of reduced scale. The I-V relations of samples much thicker than the equilibrium Debye length reduce to the ones obtained assuming local neutrality throughout the sample. The results also depend significantly on the reaction constant between the acceptors and holes to form neutral acceptors.",

In addition, some of these samples manifest remarkable temperature-dependent resonances near 1.3\u20131.6\u00a0eV. The minimal model suggested to explain both effects implies the CuO nanoceramic to be a metastable system of metallic-like nanoscale droplets with Drude optical response, nucleating in the bare insulating medium under the stimulating influence of the conditions of the specimen treatment. Simple effective medium theory is shown to provide a reasonable description of the experimental spectra in terms of the plasmon features due to the droplet phase.",

Rietveld analysis of electrochemically grown films reveals pure copper(I) oxide with no copper(II) oxide or copper metal present in the films and a lattice parameter of a = 0.4266 nm. The cathodic deposition current is limited by a Schottky-like barrier that forms between the Cu2O and the deposition solution. A barrier height of 0.6 eV was determined from the exponential dependence of the deposition current on the solution temperature. At a solution pH of 9 the orientation of the film is [100], while at a solution pH of 12 the orientation changes to [111]. Atomic force images of the [100] oriented films have crystals shaped as four-sided pyramids, while the [111] films have triangular crystals. The grain size for films grown at 65 oC ranges from 2 to 5 mum. A refractive index of 2.6 was measured from the transmission spectrum for wavelengths between 1350 and 2800 nm. The p-type semiconductor has a direct bandgap of 2.1 eV.",

The morphology of nanowires, obtained at different oxidation temperatures and times, was determined. The diameter of nanowires was found to depend linear on temperature whereas the time dependence of their length is modeled by a parabolic law. The results suggest that CuO nanowires are formed as a result of the competition between grain boundary and lattice diffusion of Cu atoms across a Cu2O layer. Electrical characterization of the nanowires was also performed. A field effect transistor was produced with an isolated nanowire showing p-type characteristics. The resistivity, mobility, and density of carriers were calculated. Nanowire growth by thermal oxidation is very simple and has great potential to be used for large scale production; this opens possibilities for various kinds of application.",

      "abstractNote": "In a number of crystals at low temperatures a complex structure of distinct strong lines at the edge of fundamental absorption is observed. There is reason to believe that the structure is connected with the creation of excitons predicted by fSprenkel. In Cu2O one can observe a hydrogen-like series of narrow lines: showing the existence of Mott excitons in the crystal. The fact that their diameters are very large is confirmed by ionization (dissociation) of excitons observed even in weak electric fields (1 kV/cm). The quadratic diamagnetic Zeeman effect is detected in Cu2O and CdS which is a proof of the large dimensions of excitons and their enormous diamagnetism. The linear paramagnetic Zeeman effect of the members of the Cu2O series was not observed. That proves the existence of positronium-like excitons with equal effective masses of electron and hole. On the other hand some of the Cu2O and CdS absorption lines show the linear Zeeman splitting only. This can be explained by excitation of localized excitons whose radii do not exceed the size of the crystal cell. In such a case the spectra of ortho- and para-excitons may be different. Another phenomenon was observed in a magnetic field near the series limit of the Cu2O exciton spectrum. A group of almost equidistant absorption maxima beyond the exciton series limit with a fine structure has been detected. These maxima are due to the diamagnetic levels of LSpandau. The spacing between successive maxima is determined by the exciton cyclotron frequency which is equal to the halfsum of the cyclotron frequencies of the electron and hole. In luminescence in a number of crystals, narrow emission lines are observed at the very edge of the fundamental absorption nearly coinciding with the absorption lines. Some of these may have appeared as a result of annihilation of excitons with the emission of light. Some of the crystals show a fine structure of the spectral dependence of photoconductivity which is closely related to the line structure of the absorption edge. This reveals the role of excitons in photoconductivity.",

      "abstractNote": "The exciton fine structure of the fundamental absorption edge in semiconductor crystals was examined. It was observed that substances having such a structure are fairly strong photo-conductors. This fact leads to the conclusion that there is a correlation between the exciton absorption lines and the shape of the photoconductivity curve. Crystals with well-known structures of the absorption edge (CdS, Cu2O, HgI2, PbI2 and GaSe) were chosen for investigation. A fine structure of the spectral curves of photoconductivity, corresponding to exciton absorption lines, was discovered in all the investigated crystals at low temperatures. Its properties in a CdS single crystal were studied in detail. It turned out that either the maxima (first type of crystals) or the minima (second type of crystals) on the photocurrent curves could correspond to the exciton absorption lines. By means of proper treatment crystals can be converted from one type into another and vice versa. The coincidence of photocurrent and absorption maxima is considered as a consequence of exciton participation in giving rise to photocurrent. Possible mechanisms of exciton participation in creating charge carriers are discussed. On the spectral curve of luminescence excitation of CdS crystals at low temperatures, a fine structure related to the exciton spectrum is also observed. Either maxima or minima on the excitation spectral curve coincide with the exciton absorption lines.",

Distinctly pronounced oscillating structure with energy period of LO phonon can be observed in the E.S. of all exciton emission lines. This structure arises due to kinetic energy relaxation processes in exciton bands, the appearance of oscilations is conditioned by incomplete thermalization of excitons during exciton life-time. Observation of discrete structure in the E.S. permits one to draw some conclusions concerning the mechanism of exciton formation under optical excitation. Creation of excitons with kinetic energies up to 0,2 eV, considerably exceeding the binding energy 0.03 eV, was observed. Non-equilibrium character of zerophonon free exciton emission is briefly discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "A pulsed electrodeposition technique based on a multipulse sequence of potentials of equal amplitude, duration and polarity was employed for preparation of highly dispersed flower-like cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles. The morphology analysis of the particles using scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveals that the flower-like particles were from sequential growth of Cu2O along the (1\ufffd1\ufffd1) direction on the cubic Cu2O (1\ufffd0\ufffd0). The structure and the chemical composition of the deposits were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Optical property and band gap of the Cu2O was investigated using UV/vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS), and the measured value of energy gap is 2.18\ufffdeV. The dark and light open circuit potential-time characterization study showed that the flower-like Cu2O nanoparticles exhibited good photoelectric response. Cyclic voltammetry carried out in the presence of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) shows that the electrocatalytic performance of the Cu2O particles for the reduction of p-NP, which was characterized by a cathodic peak at around -0.6\ufffdV. The influence of the incidence of light on the electrocatalysis is also discussed.",

The adsorption capacity of both CuO and ZnO for H2S from aqueous solutions was determined under various conditions of temperature and solution pH. Equilibrium data were used to construct adsorption isotherms and to fit various adsorption models. Results show that increasing temperature leads to an increase in the adsorption capacity of both oxides. Studying the effect of pH at 4, 7 and 11 show that the maximum adsorption capacity of CuO is attained at pH 7. However, the Redlich-Peterson isotherm shows a better fit than both the Langmuir and Fruendlich isotherms.",

      "abstractNote": "It is found, for the first time in the field of solid state spectroscopy, that quasi-Landau levels in magneto-oscillatory spectra in cuprous oxide reflect \"classical non-integrability.\" Cuprous oxide is well known to exhibit excitonic absorption spectra of typical wannier type near the absorption edge in yellow spectral region. Magneto-oscillatory spectra are observed in the region above the limiting energy of the exciton series in magnetic fields. The spectra are measured at liquid helium temperature with right and left circularly polarized light in magnetic fields up to 4.5\u00c2\u00a0T generated by a superconducting magnet. The observed spectra look like \"Landau levels\" corresponding to the optical transitions between states of the hole in a valence band and those of the electron in a conduction band without Coulomb attraction between them qualitatively, but never coincide with the Landau levels quantitatively. By calculating inverse Fourier transform of the observed spectra (IFFT spectra), three peaks are found in the auto-correlation function of the excited excitonic state. These spectra are interpreted as those of a hydrogen type atom with the effective masses of the electron-hole pair in homogeneous magnetic field, which is known to be a typical non-integrable system in classical mechanics. Instead of obtaining the quantum mechanical motions of wave packet, the classical trajectories are numerically calculated. First peak of the IFFT spectra is assigned to the trajectories on which the wave packet circulates and returns to approximately to the starting point after the duration corresponding to the first peak. Immediately after that, the trajectories are rapidly apart from the starting point on account of their instability, which reflects the classical non-integrability of the system.",

Then the films were annealed in air at 500\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C for 12\u00c2\u00a0h, and the formation of cupric oxide observed. The annealed films were further treated by nitrogen plasma at a power of 800\u00c2\u00a0W for 10 and 20\u00c2\u00a0min. The color of the film clearly changed from black to reddish brown over 10\u00c2\u00a0min. X-ray diffraction patterns show that the annealed films were cupric oxide and included cuprous oxide diffraction peaks observed aftert 10\u00c2\u00a0min in nitrogen plasma. The resistivity of annealed films was 16.7\u00c2\u00a0[Omega] cm, and was reduced markedly to about one order of magnitude under nitrogen plasma. Annealing in air and nitrogen plasma treating shifted the optical band gap from 2.1\u00c2\u00a0eV to 2.4\u00c2\u00a0eV. The relationship between the microstructure and plasma content of the films and their properties is investigated.",

The p-n homojunction Cu2O solar cells showed a conversion efficiency of 0.1% under AM1 illumination.

      "abstractNote": "N-type doping of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) films by chlorine (Cl) during electrodeposition was reported by the authors recently. A more detailed study on the effects of doping conditions on electrical properties of Cl-doped Cu2O is presented in this paper. The resistivity of Cl-doped Cu2O is affected by doping conditions, including Cu and Cl concentrations, different Cu and Cl precursors, complexing agent concentration, solution pH, and deposition temperature. It is believed that these conditions control the amount of Cl incorporated into the Cu2O films, thus the doping level. The lowest resistivity obtained so far is 7\ufffd[Omega]-cm, suitable for solar cell applications. Photocurrent-potential measurements verify the n-type conductivity of Cl-doped Cu2O. Scanning electron microscopy indicates a small grain size of around 100\ufffdnm in Cl-doped Cu2O. X-ray diffraction confirms Cu2O as the only detectable phase in the film.",

A unique method or facility in vaporizing solid-state precursors and the transportation to the CVD reactor was described. The structure of the films evolved from nano-crystalline characteristic to amorphous state as the In/Cu atomic ratio of the mixed precursors increased from 0 to 0.25. A dependence of the resistivity of the films on the indium concentration was found. A low room-temperature resistivity of 7.35 &OHgr;\ufffdcm was achieved for the sample of an In/Cu atomic ratio of 0.08, with an activation energy of 0.14\ufffdeV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study excluded the possibility that the increased conductivity of the samples came from a reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. Positive holes (hbull) induced by negatively charged defect complex were assumed to contribute to the increase of conductivity.",

      "abstractNote": "A study of the oxygen uptake vs. temperature behaviour of vacuum deposited copper films in the range 50 to 400\ufffdC under 70 mm Hg oxygen pressure showed the existence of the phases CuO0.67 and CuO. Isothermal oxidation studies show the CuO0.67 phase to be stable at the lower temperatures (150-200\ufffdC) and the CuO at the higher temperatures (>300\ufffdC). In the intermediate range (\u00a0210-290\ufffdC) the product is also intermediate between the two. The low-temperature data show that a direct logarithmic rate law is obeyed and the activation energy is 5.58 kcal/mole. At 250\ufffdC, it is logarithmic as well as inverse logarithmic. At higher temperatures (>300\ufffdC) the behaviour is inverse logarithmic, the activation energy corresponding to 5.90 kcal/mole. The reason for the formation of CuO0.67 and CuO has been explained qualitatively.",

The oxidation, as measured bythermogravimetry, was approximately parabolic. The oxidescales could be divided in two main regions: An outerregion consisting of copper oxides and an inner porousregion, which consists of Cu2O with dispersedNiO particles. NiO particles exists as internal-oxide particles. The interface between the two layersreflects the original surface, which shows that theouter part grows by outward Cu diffusion via vacancies.The inner part grows by outward diffusion of copper and inward transport of gaseous oxygen by thedissociative-transport mechanism. The amount ofporosity, the relative thickness of the inner layercompared to the total thickness of the scale, and theoxidation rate as a function of Ni content was dependenton the reaction conditions.",

These J-U characteristics at low temperatures indicate the existence of potential barriers which are related to structural defects revealed by chemical etching. This view is supported by the observed anisotropy of the conductivity at low temperatures: at 4.2 K, the conductivity in the lang001rang direction is higher than in the lang110rang direction.",

      "abstractNote": "The duplex oxide film potentiostatically formed on copper in concentrated alkaline media has been investigated by XRD, XPS, negative-going voltammetry and cathodic chronopotentiometry. The interfacial capacity was also measured using fast triangular voltage method under quasi-stationary condition. The obvious differences in the thickness, composition, passivation degree and capacitance behavior were observed between the duplex film formed in lower potential region (\u20110.13 to 0.18 V versus Hg|HgO electrode with the same solution as the electrolyte) and that formed in higher potential region (0.18 0.60 V). Cuprous oxides could be formed and exist stably in the inner layer in the both potential regions, and three cupric species, soluble ions and Cu(OH)2 and CuO, could be independently produced from the direct oxidation of metal copper, as indicated by three pairs of redox voltammetric peaks. One of the oxidation peaks appeared only after the scan was reversed from high potential and could be attributed to CuO formation upon the pre-accumulation of O2\u2011 ions within the film under high anodic potentials. A new mechanism for the film growth on the investigated time scale from 1 to 30 min is proposed, that is, the growth of the duplex film in the lower potential region takes place at the film|solution interface to form a thick Cu(OH)2 outer layer by field-assisted transfer of Cu2+ ions through the film to solution, whereas the film in the higher potential region grows depressingly and slowly at the metal|film interface to form Cu2O and less CuO by the transfer of O2\u2011 ions through the film to electrode.",

      "abstractNote": "single-crystalline thin films of copper were oxidized at an isothermal temperature of 425\u00b0C and at an oxygen partial pressure of 5\u00d710-3 Torr in situ in a high-resolution electron microscope. The specimens were prepared by epitaxial vapor deposition onto polished 100 and 110 faces of rocksalt and mounted in a hot stage inside an ultra-high-vacuum specimen chamber of the microscope. Large amounts of sulfur, carbon, and oxygen were detected by Auger electron spectroscopy on the surface of the as-received films and were removed in situ by ion-sputter etching immediately prior to the oxidation. The nucleation and growth characteristics of Cu2O on Cu were studied. The predominantly observed crystallographic orientations of Cu2O on 100 and 110 copper films were epitaxial, parallel 100 and 110 orientations, respectively. In addition, a Cu2O 111 orientation with Cu2O //Cu was found frequently on 100-oriented copper films. The distinct particle shapes observed most frequently were square and hexagonal, representing 100 and 111 orientations, respectively. An induction period of about 30 min was found, which did not depend on the film thickness but did depend strongly on the oxygen partial pressure and the oxygen exposure prior to the oxidation. Neither stacking faults nor dislocations were found to be associated with the Cu2O nucleation sites. The growth of Cu2O nuclei was found to be linear with time. The experimental findings, including results from oxygen dissolution experiments and from repetitive oxidation-reduction-oxidation sequences, fit well into the framework of an oxidation process involving (a) the formation of a surface-charge layer, (b) oxygen saturation in the metal and formation of a supersaturated zone near the surface, and (c) nucleation, followed by surface diffusion of oxygen and bulk diffusion of copper for lateral and vertical oxide growth, respectively.",

The effects of oxidation temperatures on the morphologies and crystallinity of the CuO thin films are investigated by SEM, XRD, and XPS. The electrical and hydrogen sensing properties of CuO are studied by electrical resistance measurements. In addition, the effects of carrier gases on the gas response of CuO are investigated. The results showed that Cu was oxidized into monoclinic cupric oxide in the investigated temperature range from 300 to 800\ufffd\ufffdC. The p-type semiconducting CuO thin film showed increases in electrical resistance upon exposure to hydrogen. The CuO thin film oxidized at 400\ufffd\ufffdC showed the highest response as compared to others, and it was 3.72 for 6% H2 at an operating temperature of 250\ufffd\ufffdC. The carrier gases played very important roles in the hydrogen sensing by CuO. That is, the sensor showed good response-and-recovery with a carrier gas of air but not with nitrogen.",

Oxidation is done in air at a temperature range of 300-800\ufffd\ufffdC to oxidize the Cu while removing the SWNT template. The oxidation temperature determines the stoichiometry of the CuO formed, and thus the electrical property. The structures and electrical properties of the synthesized materials are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and current-voltage measurements. Sensing property is examined using hydrogen gas. Gas sensing mechanism and the advantages of nanowire structure as a sensor are also discussed. The best response and recovery results are observed with the CuO nanowires oxidized at 400\ufffd\ufffdC at a working temperature of 250\ufffd\ufffdC.",

Compared with previous measurements, systematic errors due to thermal gradients across the zirconia solid electrolyte have been greatly reduced. Measurements with three different types of zirconia solid electrolytes have yielded results that differ by only \ufffd40 J\ufffdmol-1 (\ufffd0.2 mV). This is the best agreement yet achieved between solid electrolytes of different composition. Our recommended value for the standard molar enthalpy of formation, [Delta]fHmo(Cu2O, 298.15 K), is -(170.59\ufffd0.08) kJ\ufffdmol-1 (po = 1 \ufffd 105 Pa).",

The influence of various experimental parameters on deposition rate, film composition and resistivity have been studied. The substrate temperature and the bias are the parameters which affect these properties the most. An increase of the substrate temperature changes the phases of the deposit from Cu2O-CuO over Cu2O to Cu. At temperatures ?500\u00b0 C the deposition rates are high but the films consist mainly of metallic Cu. A negative bias enhances the deposition rate only slightly but has a strong effect on the film composition and can completely balance the oxygen deficiency. At a bias of -120 V the films consist of pure CuO even at temperatures ?500\u00b0 C.",

The microstructure of Cu2O thin films produced in the acid electrolyte changes from a ring shape to a cubic shape with increasing DC density, and the microstructure of Cu2O thin films produced in the alkaline electrolyte has a typical pyramid shape. The X-ray diffraction results show that Cu2O thin films can be electrodeposited over a larger current domain than those deposited by a three-electrode system. The growth of Cu2O thin films is examined under this domain, and the electrocrystallization process of such films is discussed taking into consideration the effect of current density on nucleation, cluster growth, and crystal growth.",

It is pointed out that owing to macroscopic field effects degeneracies cannot be ascertained on symmetry grounds alone, thus nine distinct frequencies are obtained instead of seven. A tentative estimate of the frequencies on a simple ionic model has been made, giving for one of the optically active modes ?=16.5 \u00b5, in close agreement with the observed position of the strongest absorption peak. The tentative nature of such an estimate is stressed, and effects due to electrical polarisation of the ions and possible bond angle distortion forces are briefly discussed.",

The samples were characterized by means of SEM, XRD, UV/DRS and XPS. It was presented that as-prepared Cu2O nanoparticles are substantially stable in ambient atmosphere and the Cu+ as main state exists on the surface of Cu2O nanoparticles. As-prepared Cu2O microparticles can exist stably as a Cu2O/CuO core/shell structure; and the Cu2+ as main state exists on the surface of Cu2O microparticles. The behaviors of adsorption, photocatalysis and photocorrosion of Cu2O particles with different sizes were investigated in detail. The results show that Cu2O nanoparticles are very easy to photocorrosion during the photocatalytic reaction, which cannot be used as photocatalyst directly to degrade organic compound, although as-prepared Cu2O nanoparticles exhibit special property of adsorption. Cu2O microparticles have a higher photocatalytic activity than Cu2O nanoparticles because of its slower photocorrosion rate, although Cu2O microparticles have much lower adsorption capacity than Cu2O nanoparticles. The mechanisms of photocatalysis and photocorrosion for Cu2O under visible light were also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Photoluminescence spectroscopy has been employed in order to explore the optical emission properties of a single CuO nanowire, grown on a copper grid in static air by simple thermal oxidation method. As the diameter of the single tapered CuO nanowire decreases, the green emission of the nanowire gradually shifts towards the higher energy side. A steady blue shift of 20\u00c2\u00a0nm of the photoluminescence (PL) peak has been attributed to nanosize effect. Higher surface to volume ratio and enhanced surface defects along the growth direction of the nanowire might be responsible for the observed PL behavior. In addition, crystallization process along the length of the nanowire during growth to form pure CuO structure from the precursor state may also have some role in observed shift in the PL peak.",

The results demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity of the TNT was significantly enhanced by the incorporation of octahedral Cu2O. Furthermore, exposure of a large area of 1\ufffd1\ufffd1 facets of octahedral Cu2O into TNT arrays augments the adsorption property and photocatalytic activity of TNT.",

A high quality copper film prepared by ion beam deposition under a substrate bias voltage of \u201150 V (IBD Cu film at Vs = \u201150 V) showed an oxidation resistance as high as an ultra high purity copper (UHP Cu) bulk, whereas a Cu film deposited without substrate bias voltage (IBD Cu film at Vs = 0 V) showed lower oxidation resistance. The growth of Cu2O layer on the UHP Cu bulk and both types of the films obeyed in principle a logarithmic rate law. However, the growth of oxide layer on the IBD Cu films at Vs = 0 and \u201150 V deviated upward from the logarithmic rate law after the exposure time of 320 and 800 h, respectively. The deviation from the logarithmic law is due to the formation of CuO on the Cu2O layer after a critical time.",

The layer sequence of products Cu2O/Cu/NiO/Ni for the undoped sample and that of Cu2O/Cu/NiO/Cu\u2013Ni alloy/Ni for the doped sample was obtained. The reaction and diffusion path was explained on the chemical potential diagram of the Cu\u2013Ni\u2013O system, based on the assumption that a local equilibrium is attained at the interfaces. The doping effect of NiO in Cu2O was ascribed to a higher mobility of copper in NiO phase due to the higher chemical potential of oxygen at the Cu/NiO interface resulting from the higher chemical potential of nickel in Cu2O. When the reaction time becomes longer, it is expected that the reaction and diffusion path will become similar to that of the doped sample. Because the reaction and diffusion path is a function of time and has a non-equilibrium character, it can be represented and reasonably explained on the chemical potential diagram obtained from a thermodynamic treatment.",

Furthermore, the CO2 sensing property of the resultant CuO thin films on a porous BaTiO3 was investigated as a capacitive type sensor. Self-assembled bilayer films of a few 1000 layers thickness can be readily obtained by casting an aqueous suspension composed of dimethyldihexadecylammoniun bromide (DC1\u201316), Cu(CH3CO2)2 , hexadecylethylenediamine and poly(vinyl alcohol). Divalent copper ions (Cu2+) which are associated with two hexadecylethylenediamine molecules were arranged in the hydrophobic layer of the multibilayer film. Rapid heating to the combustion temperature of DC1\u201316 was desirable for removing organic molecules in the multibilayer template. Thin films of CuO can be obtained by calcination at temperatures higher than 573 K. The resultant CuO thin films were porous and consisted of fine particles. The capacitance of CuO thin films prepared from self-assembled multibilayer films as a molecular template on the BaTiO3 porous substrate exhibited a high sensitivity to CO2 , which is twice that of a conventional mixed oxide capacitor of CuO\u2013BaTiO3 . The capacitance of CuO thin films on BaTiO3 increases with increasing CO2 concentration in the range from 100 ppm to 50% at 873 K. Consequently, it is concluded that CuO thin films on BaTiO3 were appropriate capacitive type CO2 sensors.",

Photoluminescence spectra of these crystals were studied to examine the concentration of defects, especially copper vacancy VCu to seek favourable conditions for growing Cu2O crystal. High-quality single crystals of Cu2O were prepared by the floating-zone melting method in air. Several synthetic crystals (specimens FA, FZ and GZ) and also a natural crystal were studied by X-ray analysis, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy analysis, optical absorption, photoluminescence, photoconductivity and cyclotron resonance absorption, photoluminescence, photoconductivity and cyclotron resonance absorption to characterize their optical and electrical qualities. The best values of mobility and scattering time of photocarriers at T = 4.2 K are estimated to be \u00b5h\u02dc1.8 \u00d7 105 cm2 V-1 s-1 and th\u02dc60 ps for positive holes, and \u00b5\u2022\u02dc1.3 \u00d7 105 cm2 V-1 s-1 and t\u2022\u02dc70 ps for electrons in Cu2O. Further, we report preliminary experimental results on transport property of crystals also of cupric oxide (CuO) purified by the floating-zone melting method.",

The CuO crystals having a grain size of the order of 1\u00d71 mm2 were successfully grown by a floating-zone melting technique. Dielectric-function spectra of polycrystalline CuO reveal distinct structures at energies of E1\u223c1.6 eV, E2\u223c2.0 eV, E3\u223c2.6 eV and E4\u223c3.4 eV. These spectra are analyzed on the basis of a harmonic oscillator approximation. Dielectric-related optical constants, such as the complex refractive index (n*=n+ ik), absorption coefficient (\u03b1) and normal-incidence reflectivity (R), of CuO are also presented.",

      "abstractNote": "The method of multistep irradiation of a Cu2O substrate by an H+ ion beam has been introduced for the preparation of Cu/Cu2O Schottky barrier solar cells. Cu2O samples were exposed first to an H+ beam with the beam voltage Vb fixed between 150 and 950 V (step I) and subsequently to a radiation dose of low energy H+ ions (Vb = 150 V) (step II). Both dark and illuminated (air mass 1) current-voltage characteristics of the cells were examined at 300 K after each step of the junction formation process. A detailed analysis of the influence of step II of the process on the main solar cell parameters (Voc, Jsc, fill factor and [eta]) and the diode parameters (n and J0) has been performed. The quality of the thin film copper electrode layer obtained by H+-ion-induced surface reduction of Cu2O was found to be better than that obtained by the single-step process. This resulted in an improvement in the conversion efficiency of Cu/Cu2O Schottky barrier solar cells up to [eta] [approximate] 1.5%.",

Both, dark and illuminated (AMI) current-voltage characteristics of the cells are recorded at room temperature after each step of the junction formation process. Especially, the influence of H+ ion beam voltage, Ub, on the main solar cell parameters is analysed here. It is proved that low energy H+ ion irradiation (0 &lt; Ub &lap; 250 V) provides significant enhancement of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the Cu/Cu2O solar cells.",

The films were annealed in the temperature range 200-1200 \ufffdC and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-VIS-NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy. In the UV-VIS spectra of the films most of the UV and visible bands shifted towards longer wavelengths with increasing annealing temperature and the corresponding Cu2O microcrystallite size was evaluated from the shifting of the UV bands (271-371 nm). Wannier hydrogen-like excitonic transitions, e.g., blue, green, yellow series of Cu2O excitons were observed in the visible region. Excitation dependent fluorescence bands were observed in the visible region and the 400 nm excitation depicted two distinct fluorescence bands in the green ([small tilde] 525 nm) and red ([small tilde] 630 nm) regions. The intensity ratios of green and red fluorescences and vice versa were found to be dependent on the microcrystallite size. Tentative band assignments have been proposed from the excitonic absorption and fluorescence bands.",

Rate-equation models including Auger recombination (A), spin-flip scattering (B) and capture into short-lived biexcitons (C) are compared to photoluminescence data for a crystal temperature of 2\ufffdK. Process B--converting two orthoexcitons into two paraexcitons by exchanging electrons and holes--leaves the total exciton number unchanged and is inconsistent with the late-time data. In processes A and C, paraexcitons re-generate high energy excitons in agreement with the late-time data; however, the existing theory of Auger recombination seems to eliminate process A, leaving molecule formation as the dominant process.",

      "abstractNote": "The lifetime of dense orthoexcitons in Cu2O is severely limited by dark molecule formation. In order to investigate this two-body process for orthoexciton-polaritons, we employ two-photon excitation and resonantly create orthoexciton-polaritons at 2\ufffdK, which are the coherent quantum superposition of orthoexcitons and the light field. Based on the steady-state analysis, we find that this density-dependent process is an order of magnitude reduced for resonantly created orthoexciton-polaritons compared with thermalized orthoexcitons at 2\ufffdK. This most likely arises from the photonic character of an orthoexciton-polariton. Considering the greatly reduced effective mass of the orthoexciton-polariton, this implies that the experimentally achievable orthoexciton-polariton densities can be above the critical density for Bose-Einstein condensation. However, insufficient elastic scattering seems to keep this propagating quantum ensemble from internal equilibrium.",

      "abstractNote": "Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and cupric oxide (CuO) thin films were prepared by thermal oxidation of copper films coated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and non-alkaline glass substrates. The formation of Cu2O and CuO was controlled by varying oxidation conditions such as, oxygen partial pressure, heat treatment temperature, and oxidation time. The microstructure, crystal direction, and optical properties of copper oxide films were measured with X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and optical spectroscopy. The results indicated that the phase-pure Cu2O and CuO films were produced in the oxidation process. Optical transmittance and reflectance spectra of Cu2O and CuO clearly exhibited distinct characteristics related to their phases. The electrical properties indicated that these films formed ohmic contacts with Cu and ITO electrode materials. Multilayers of Cu2O/CuO were fabricated by choosing the oxidation sequence. The experimental results in this paper suggest that the thermal oxidation method can be employed to fabricate device quality Cu2O and CuO films that are up to 200-300\ufffdnm thick.",

This photoresponse was much higher than the previously published values for n-Cu2O electrodes which were prepared by other methods. The photocurrent obtained was in the order of 0.3\ufffdmA/cm2 when the cell was illuminated with light intensity of 50\ufffdmW/cm2. (The semiconductor electrode was biased to get a zero dark current.) The power conversion efficiency of the cell was 0.01%. The maximum quantum efficiency obtained was 15%. It is hoped that these values could be improved with a better understanding of the photoelectrochemical properties of the cell.",

This leads to the acceleration of the ceramic layer formation on SUS surface during granite-water vapor interaction in the presence of copper. In this paper, we have determined the chemical state of copper at which the mass transfer takes place through reaction with H2 and O2+N2 gas mixture at the different O2 amount. Obtained results indicate that the weight loss of copper plate occurs at Cu2O (+1) state due to a complex processes. The morphology of copper species on the surface of mesh and granite suggests that the Cu2O was dissolved in water vapor and recrystallized on the surface of mesh and granite. Copper species were characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX).",

      "abstractNote": "A complete analysis of the line shape of the excitonic absorption and photoluminescence lines of the yellow series of Cu2O is given. A detailed fit to the absorption lines up to the n = 5 exciton according to Toyozawa's theory gives precise values for the excitonic resonance energies, allowing to calculate the excitonic Rydberg. The fit to the photoluminescence lines shows very good agreement with experimental data at different temperatures. At high excitation, the fit to the excitonic absorption lines reveals the fundamental mechanism for bleaching of exciton absorption lines in Cu2O. Based on these findings, a new all-optical method for the observation of exciton transport in Cu2O is proposed.",

The effect of humidity and the vapors of various liquids on the surface conductivity of rectifiers is investigated. The results obtained are discussed and a mechanism to explain the presence of a conduction channel at the p-n junction of cuprous-oxide rectifiers is suggested.",

It was revealed that there are current transport mechanisms at the junction which are leading to high voltage currents. Namely, an oscillatory behaviour of the current with the temperature was observed under reverse bias conditions. This behaviour was interpreted as the thermally enhanced tunneling at the junction due to the existence of defect interface states. We believe that proper surface treatment might reduce the density if interface states and thereby improve the I-V characteristics of the diode.",

The reduction behaviour and the existence of an intermediate state were investigated by using synchrotron-based high-resolution in situ x-ray diffraction (S-XRD) techniques. The results revealed that CuO directly reduces to metallic Cu ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/16/33/008/cm175281ieqn1.gif] Cu\u00b2\u207a  Cu\u2070 ), under a normal flow of hydrogen. There was no hint of an intermediate state (Cu 1+ ) during the reduction. In certain conditions, however, an intermediate phase (Cu 2 O) appears under either very small flow of hydrogen (20 \u00b0C\u00a0min \u22121 ), suggesting that the reduction kinetics strongly depends on reduction conditions.",

XPS showed that copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) and copper (II) oxide (CuO) were reduced to copper metal at 400 K within a 30 min exposure to deuterium atoms (D*) and molecules at 1\u00d710-4 Torr. Similarly, XPS showed that Cu2O was reduced to copper metal at 400 K within a 30 min exposure to methyl radicals (CH3*) and acetone molecules at 1\u00d710-4 Torr. After D* exposure, TPD showed O leaves the Cu2O surface as D2O from 400 K to 700 K with a peak desorption temperature of 510 K. After CH3* exposure, TPD showed O leaves the Cu2O surface as CO2 over a range from 400 to 700 K with a peak temperature at 590 K. With carbon impurity below the XPS detection limit, thermal reduction of CuO to Cu2O was verified by XPS near 890 K. TPD experiments showed that O leaves the CuO surface as O2 at 890 K. Without surface C, thermal reduction of Cu2O was not observed up to 1073 K. Reduction of Cu2O without reactive radical species (D* or CH3*) was negligible. These results suggest that thin films of copper oxide can be reduced at 400 K with D* and CH3*.",

The deposition conditions, based on the phase relations of the films, were investigated in terms of solution concentration and substrate temperature. Also, the formation process was kinetically discussed. The Cu2O thin film obtained here was composed of rounded grains 223C50 nm in size with a surface roughness of 223C30 nm. This film was reddish yellow and showed indirect and direct bandgap energies of 1.95 and 2.60 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the film exhibited p-type conduction, with a resistivity of 223C100 Omegacm.",

      "abstractNote": "Summary The ability to prepare inorganic nanocrystals with well-defined morphologies and sharp faces should facilitate the examination of their facet-dependent surface, catalytic, electrical, and other properties. In this review we cover different synthetic methods for the growth of Cu2O nanocrystals with morphological control. Cu2O nanocrystals with cubic, cuboctahedral, truncated octahedral, octahedral, and multipod structures have been prepared mainly by wet chemical, electrodeposition, and solvothermal synthesis methods. Methods used for the formation of hollow Cu2O nanocubes, octahedra, and truncated rhombic dodecahedra are also presented. Morphology of Cu2O nanocrystals can be expanded with the use of gold nanocrystal cores to guide the overgrowth of Cu2O shells. Surface properties of Cu2O nano- and microcrystals with sharp faces have been examined in a few studies. The 1\ufffd1\ufffd1 faces were found to interact well with negatively charged molecules, while the 1\ufffd0\ufffd0 faces are less sensitive to molecular charges. Preferential adsorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate molecules on the 1\ufffd1\ufffd1 faces of Cu2O crystals has been demonstrated via plane-selective deposition of gold nanoparticles on only the 1\ufffd0\ufffd0 faces. It is expected that the development of improved synthetic methods for Cu2O nanocrystals and more knowledge of their facet-dependent properties should lead to their applications in photoactivated energy conversion and catalysis.",

      "abstractNote": "We have applied the augmented plane-wave plus local-orbitals method to investigate the charge density of Cu2O by means of Bader\u2019s topological analysis and electric-field gradients (EFGs). It is rather clear that a simple Cu+-O2- model is inadequate for the explanation of bonding properties of Cu2O. Appearance of s-d hybridization in this system has been pointed out already in the literature. However, the amount of charge transferred from d to s Cu orbitals is overestimated by both the local-density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation. As a result, the calculated EFG is underestimated by about 50% compared to experiment. Also the topological analysis of calculated densities suggests that density-functional theory overestimates the covalency of the Cu-O bond. In order to demonstrate the role of s-d hybridization as the main reason for the mentioned discrepancies, we have utilized artificially modified basis sets. Removing part of the 4s Cu character from the wave function increases the absolute EFGs and decreases the calculated bulk modulus, both resulting in better agreement with experiment. This is a result of an increased Cu d occupation and consequently a decreased asphericity of the d charge distribution. A more physical description of the localized nature of the 3d orbitals should be given by the LDA+U correction. We find that LDA+U \u201cself-interaction corrected\u201d (SIC) by Anisimov et al. [V.I. Anisimov, I.V. Solovyev, M.A. Korotin, M.T. Czy\u017cyk, and G.A. Sawatzky, Phys. Rev. B 48, 16 929 (1993)] leads to EFGs in good agreement with experiment while LDA+U \u201caround mean field\u201d Cy\u017cyk and Sawatzky [Phys. Rev. B 49, 14 211 (1994)] even worsens the results. This is to be expected according to the analysis given above, which indicates that the on-site correlations are important but are implemented only in the LDA+U (SIC) method.",

For a partially-oxidized Cu film, CuO was reduced to Cu2O around 380\ufffdK, and the Cu2O concentration decreased with increasing annealing temperature and fell below the XPS detection limit at 673\ufffdK. For a fully-oxidized Cu film, CuO started to form Cu2O around 473\ufffdK, and Cu began to appear at 673\ufffdK.

Two cuprous oxides Cu2O and Cu3O2 have been studied. The absorption of Cu2O films in the range 450-630 nm is mainly due to non-stoichiometry bands associated with copper and oxygen vacancies. Cu3O2 is characterized by an optical band gap greater than that of Cu2O (respectively 2.25 and 1.95 eV) and by an intense luminescence emission at 760-780 nm. Cu3O2 may be considered as a gross defect structure of Cu2O (aCu2O = 0.427 nm, aCu3O2 = 0.431 nm). The experimental approach of the oxidation mechanism reveals that at 423 K Cu2O is the primary product which later on is transformed into Cu3O2. Experimental and calculated optical absorption curves disclose the nucleation of CuO inside the cuprous oxides layer for oxidation in the range 473-523 K.",

The mechanism of reduction has been established for layers containing CuO and a non stoichiometric copper(I) oxide. CuO is reduced before cuprous oxide. In complicated cases, it is impossible to draw conclusions from the characteristics of the electrochemical reduction (the first step of CuO reduction and the reduction of Cu(I) species specific of the non-stoichiometry are observed at the same potential). Nevertheless, the association of a non-destructive technique such as diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electrochemical methods allows identification of the different species present in corrosion layers on copper surfaces.",

Dark field images show that isolated and large Cu2O grains emerge from the small CuO grain matrix. The abrupt change in oxygen concentration across the phase boundary between CuO and Cu2O in the reaction is different from the continuous change of \u03b4 in oxidation and reduction of the superconducting YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 oxide. The growth of Cu2O grains is linear with time and has an activation energy of 1.1 eV. We propose that the discontinuous morphology of grain growth of Cu2O is due to the migration of the Cu2O-CuO phase boundary induced by oxygen out diffusion along the moving phase boundary.",

The highly ordered macroporous structure with a hexagonal array can be extended over hundreds of square micrometers. The photonic stop bands of both the PS colloidal crystal and Cu2O 3DOM were found. Due to the highly ordered porous structure, the optical absorption and the charge carrier transportation are better in Cu2O 3DOM than in bulk Cu2O, which makes the reduction of oxygen faster on Cu2O 3DOM than on bulk Cu2O under visible light illumination. The higher photocurrent efficiency under visible light illumination makes the 3DOM Cu2O more suitable for solar applications.",

X-ray diffraction indicates a unique epitaxial 45\u00b0[001] orientation relationship between Cu2O and InP. This reduces the mismatch between corresponding spacings to 2.9%, compared with a mismatch of 27.2% between the lattice parameters of Cu2O and InP. The morphology of the Cu2O film can be influenced via the electrolyte acidity. At a pH of 9.0, Cu2O forms pyramidal islands. At a pH of 12.0, on the other hand, cubelike morphologies of Cu2O are observed. Between a pH of 9.0 and 12.0, the direction of slowest growth changes from <111> to <100>. In apparent contradiction to the observation of a unique epitaxial orientation relationship, transmission electron microscopy reveals an amorphous oxygen-rich interlayer between the Cu2O and the InP crystal.",

      "abstractNote": "There is a 40-year long history in the search for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons in semiconductors. This thesis presents research directed toward this goal in bulk crystal Cu2O in three dimensions and in GaAs-based coupled quantum wells (CQW) in two dimensions. The Auger recombination process in Cu2O plays a major role in limiting the density of the excitons. We find that the rate for this process increases with applied stress and lattice temperature. We create paraexcitons in Cu2O through a resonant two-photon excitation in a harmonic potential trap with the Auger recombination process as small as possible (at low temperature and low stress), and find that the exciton creation efficiency in the resonant two-photon excitation is greater for one-beam excitation than for two colliding pulses, but the colliding pulse method may be useful for direct creation of a condensate in the ground state. The paraexciton density in this work is about thirty times less than the required density for BEC of paraexcitons. One promising direction for BEC of excitons in Cu2O is that with higher laser power from stronger IR laser sources, or at lower temperature, the critical density can be approached under one-beam two-photon excitation resonant with the paraexciton state. In two dimensions, the CQW structure has been modified with four design strategies: highest possible barriers, introducing into the barriers a superlattice of 60 angstrom GaAs wells, p-i-n doping, and wider quantum wells, which provides indirect excitons low disorder and high mobility. With a cold near-resonant excitation, we conclude that the excitons act as a free gas, travelling distances of hundreds of microns. We also present observations of a narrow beam of emitted light, when the indirect excitons are confined in a two-dimensional harmonic potential trap, in a way quite similar to the first observations of BEC in alkali atoms. A beam-like emission has been suggested as a telltale for BEC of excitons. This opens the door to a whole range of investigations, including attempts to observe coherence of the emitted light, proof of superfludity of the excitons, and other fascinating effects.",

Confining the excitons to a constant volume in a harmonic-potential trap made with inhomogeneous applied stress along the [001] axis, we find that paraexcitons are created directly, and orthoexcitons appear primarily through a up-conversion of the paraexcitons. Also we generate excitons with two colliding pulses, and the luminescence is weaker than that from one beam excitation with same total laser power. These results show that resonant one-beam two-photon generation of paraexcitons is a promising way to pursue Bose-Einstein condensation of paraexcitons.",

Different types of samples including Cu plate/TiO2 pellet samples and TiO2/Cu/TiO2 sandwiched samples were prepared. The samples would react with each other at as considerably low as about 900\ufffdC in air, which is due to a eutectic reaction. The reaction diagram was generated, in which different reaction categories were denoted at various temperatures (300-1070\ufffdC) and times. After annealing, the weight changes normalized to the original Cu samples were also analyzed to verify the eutectic reaction. The eutectic was identified to be the CuO-TiO2 system characterized from XRD and EPMA analyses. Annealing in N2/O2=9 at the same temperature as in air resulted in similar but not so drastic eutectic melting phenomena. The eutectic reaction would enhance significantly the grain growth of TiO2 and the oxidation of Cu. The changes in the microstructures and the morphologies of the samples were also investigated. The eutectic temperatures of CuO and other oxide systems were compared and discussed. The eutectic points as well as the phase diagram of the CuO-TiO2 system were calculated and analyzed. Several potential applications of the reactions were also proposed.",

      "abstractNote": "Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a direct-gap semiconductor with band-gap energy of 2.0\u00c2\u00a0eV and is regarded as one of the most promising materials for application in photovoltaic cells. Practical application has not been achieved to date because of the difficulty of controlling its electrical properties such as reducing the resistivity. It is known that nitrogen doping is one of the effective methods to reduce the resistivity of cuprous oxide films. In this study, N-doped cuprous oxide films have been deposited onto Corning 1737 at a constant substrate temperature of 350\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C using a magnetron co-sputtering process in a mixture of oxygen and argon gases. It was found that the hole carrier concentration of nitrogen-doped cuprous oxide films increased from 9.0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u2014\u00c2\u00a01017\u00c2\u00a0cm-3 to 4.0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u2014\u00c2\u00a01018\u00c2\u00a0cm-3 as the nitrogen flow rate increased from 4 to 12\u00c2\u00a0ml\u00c2\u00a0min-1. The lowest resistivity of Cu2O film doped with nitrogen obtained in this study was 14.8\u00c2\u00a0[Omega]\u00c2\u00a0cm and further downed to a value of 9.1\u00c2\u00a0[Omega]\u00c2\u00a0cm after 1\u00c2\u00a0min of hydrogen plasma treatment. Because the mobility of the carrier is almost constant, it is believed that the hydrogen plasma treatment may terminate the dangling bonds of Cu and result in increasing the carrier concentration which leads to decrease in the resistivity of the Cu2O films.",

Their photocatalytic property is evaluated by the photodegradation of brilliant red dye under visible light irradiation. For comparison, Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes are synthesized and evaluated with photocatalytic property as well. The results show that the photocatalytic activity of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanorods is more than one time higher than that for Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes under visible light. Additionally, the structure of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanorods is very stable and they can not be oxidized to CuO even during the photocatalytic reaction process. It is noticeable that this kind of Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanorods has remarkable large surface areas 47.6 m<sup>2</sup>/g, which is about forty times as large as that for as-prepared Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes and it is also three times larger than that for the reported porous Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles. The large surface area of Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanorods leads to its higher adsorption ability to the brilliant red dye and excellent high photocatalytic activity under visible light. Since Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanorods are very stable and have high photocatalytic activity under visible light, they are expected to be used in photocatalytic oxidation technology practically in the future.",

      "abstractNote": "Electrochemical deposition of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin films on tin-oxide-coated glass and copper substrates by cathodic reduction of alkaline cupric lactate solution has been investigated between 60 and 80\u00c2\u00b0C. Deposition kinetics of cuprous oxide thin films were studied and the parameters limit for the deposition of the films were determined. Structure of the deposited film is simple cubic with a preferential orientation of (2\u00c2\u00a00\u00c2\u00a00). Optical absorption studies reveal 1.99\u00c2\u00a0eV for band gap and optical constants (n,k) are evaluated. Electrical resistivity studies are carried out in the temperature range 27-330\u00c2\u00b0C. The effect of annealing on the resistivity of Cu2O films are also studied and the results are discussed.",

Deposition of Cu2O thin films by electrodeposition from aqueous solutions is a low temperature and inexpensive technique. in the present work, Cu2O thin films were cathodically deposited on Cu and tin oxide coated glass substrates by the cathodic reduction of copper (II) lactate solution. The optimized deposition conditions to synthesize cuprous oxide thin films were experimentally identified as; Deposition potential: \u22120.555 V versus SCE, pH: 9.0 0.1, Bath temperature: 70\u2218C. X-ray diffraction studies revealed the formation of single phase cubic Cu2O films. The effect of annealing on the structure and morphology of Cu2O thin films are studied. The dielectric susceptibility, optical conductivity and packing density are evaluated. Photoelectrochemical solar cells based on p-Cu2O films are constructed. Spectral response studies indicate a peak in photo current density around 600 nm corresponding to the band gap of Cu2O thin films. The effects of annealing, chemical etching and photo etching on the solar cell parameters are studied.",

The best-fit values of the Cij and dCij/dP are: C11 = 1228.8, C44 = 121.0, Cprime = (C11-C12)/2 = 81.9 kbar, dC11/dP = 3.62, dC44/dP = -0.69, and dCprime/dP = -0.63, respectively. The elastic behavior of Cu2O is found to be anomalous in that dC44/dP and dCprime/dP are both negative, and dmu/dP, where mu is the isotropic shear modulus, is significantly negative (-0.67). This anomalous behavior suggests an instability of crystal structure. The high- and low-temperature limiting values of Gr\ufffdneisen gamma, gammaH and gammaL, computed from the dCij/dP are -1.98 and -3.59, respectively. The value of gammaH is in fairly good agreement with the reported Gr\ufffdneisen gamma value based on the nuclear quadrupole relaxation data. The negative Gr\ufffdneisen gamma values are consistent with the observed negative thermal expansion. The implication of gammaL being appreciable more negative than gammaH is that the coefficient of thermal expansion of Cu2O should become more negative at low temperatures.",

      "abstractNote": "Cu2O films on flexible copper and molybdenum (Mo) substrates were prepared by electrodeposition form an alkaline bath. The as-deposited films were p-type and the XRD analysis revealed that the film contains only the Cu2O phase. The thickness of the films was calculated from the interference fringes in the reflection spectra. The Au/Cu2O Schottky diodes were prepared by sputtering a 15\ufffdnm thick layer of very pure gold onto the Cu2O films on Mo substrate. The probable optical transitions near the band edge were calculated from the spectral response of the device. The band gap calculated at various temperatures show a linear dependence on temperature and the absolute zero value of the band gap is deduced as 2.206\ufffdeV. The 2.493\ufffdeV direct transition observed in the room temperature shows a temperature dependence. Evidence of phonon assisted indirect transitions were observed at various temperature regions.",

      "abstractNote": "High resolution measurements of the 1S yellow exciton quadrupole absorption line of Cu2O have been undertaken in order to study the effects of some physico-chemical parameters (dislocations, impurities and temperature). Below 20 K, an important scattering of the residual line width is observed. A predominant effect of isoelectronic silver is pointed out in this phenomenon : the line broadening is porportional to the silver content up to 400 ppm. In spite of their similar concentrations, an analoguous correlation could not be established for other major trace impurities as Si, Ca and Mg ; nor was it the case for the dislocations. A phenomenological analysis shows that the line shape is given by a Voigt profile, obtained by convolution of a Lorentzian function of width B by a Gaussian function of width A. The variation of B as a function of temperature appears to be independent of the sample, whereas A accounts for the low temperature scattering of the line width. The former results suggest to ascribe the variation of B to an intrinsic effect of phonons and that of A to impurities. This separation is also justified on the basis of a model, developed by Haken. Supporting the previous hypothesis, the thermal variation of B is in quantitative agreement with Toyozawa's theory. The variation of A may be described by the sum of a constant term and an increasing function of temperature. The constant term is directly connected with the Silver content whereas the function describes the effect of a gradual activation of defect centres.",

Throughout the temperature range, the oxidation kinetics for all specimens obeys the parabolic oxidation rate law. The Cu2O scale grows predominantly, and the rate-determining step is concluded to be outward diffusion of copper atoms in Cu2O. The activation energy at high temperatures, where the lattice diffusion predominates, is 173 kJ/mol, but it becomes lower at intermediate temperatures and even lower at low temperatures because of the contribution of the grain boundary diffusion. At high temperatures, oxidation kinetics is almost uninfluenced by purity, but the lattice-diffusion temperature range is wider for higher-purity copper. At intermediate temperatures, copper oxidation is enhanced because trace impurities can impede growth of Cu2O grains to facilitate grain boundary diffusion. At low temperatures, grain boundary diffusion is possibly hindered by impurities segregated at grain boundaries.",

An open-circuit voltage of 0.41 V, a short-circuit current density of 7.13 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 0.42 and an energy conversion efficiency of 1.21% were obtained in a PLD-AZO/Cu2O device under AM2 solar illumination.

Inelastic neutron scattering measurements in Cu2O and lattice dynamics calculations of NTE in both Cu2O and Ag2O are reported. The phonon density of states from a polycrystalline sample of Cu2O is measured using the triple-axis spectrometer at Trombay. A lattice dynamical model is used for the calculations of phonon frequencies and their pressure dependence in the entire Brillouin zone. The experimental phonon spectrum is in fair agreement with calculations. The calculated Gr\u00fcneisen parameters for Cu2O have lower negative values in comparison with Ag2O . This results in a smaller value of negative thermal expansion coefficient in Cu2O , in fair agreement with the experimental data from the literature. An important librational mode is identified that is related to NTE. Variance of bond lengths (\u27e8ubond2\u27e9) and their temperature dependence have been calculated and compared with extended x-ray absorption fine structure data that illustrates the nature of the M-O and M-M (M=Cu,Ag) bonds in these compounds.",

The I-V characteristics and photovoltaic properties in AZO/ZnO-In2O3/Cu2O devices were considerably improved by increasing the Zn content (Zn/(In+Zn atomic ratio)) of the ZnO-In2O3 thin-film buffer layer. In addition, the photovoltaic properties of AZO/Zn1-XMgXO/Cu2O devices were found to degrade significantly as the composition (X) was increased above approximately 0.1 because of the increase in resistivity of the buffer layer. Although the spectral response of photocurrent observed in AZO/Zn1-XMgXO/Cu2O devices was considerably affected by altering the value of X, the photo-generated hole in the buffer layer of these devices was not successfully injected into the Cu2O. AZO/Cu2O heterojunctions fabricated using Cu2O sheets with a sulfurized surface exhibited ohmic I-V characteristics.",

The diffusion of radiocopper in this material at 800 to 1050\u00b0 gave a self-diffusion coefficient, D=0.0436 exp(\u221236100/RT). Virtually the same D is obtained from experiments in which radiocopper is plated on copper strips, and the distribution of activity measured in the cuprous oxide film formed on oxidation in air. The observed D values are in accord with a predicted relation k/D=4, where k is the parabolic rate constant for copper oxidation. It is suggested that parabolic rate constants with large negative entropies of activation and low heats of activation may be due to grain boundary diffusion.",

It is concluded that the mechanism of formation of the hetero-phase, double-layer scales on binary alloys constitutes a particular case of the oxidation of pure metals.",

It has been shown that, at the pressures lower than the dissociation pressure of CuO, the oxide scale formed on flat fragments of the copper specimens is compact and composed of a single layer, adhering closely to the metallic base. Growth of the scale proceeds under these conditions by outward diffusion of metal. The rate of the process under the conditions for which single-phase scales are formed increases with increasing oxygen pressure according to the equation:\n\nKp = const p O2 <sup>1/3.9</sup> . the activation energy for oxidation is 24 \u00b1 2 kcal/mole. On the basis of theFueki-Wagner method and the method proposed in the present work, the self-diffusioncoefficients of copper in cuprous oxide were calculated as a functionof oxygen pressure and temperature. It has been shown that distribution of thedefect concentration in the growing layer of the scale is linear.",

Metal sulphides show the same type of predominant defects as metal oxides, the concentration of defects in the majority of sulphides being much higher than in the corresponding oxides. Defect mobility in sulphides is generally higher than in the corresponding oxides but these differences do not exceed one order of magnitude. Thus, much higher diffusivities in the majority of sulphides are due mainly to the higher concentration of defects.",

      "abstractNote": "Semiconducting cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin films, important for low cost solar cell and oxygen or humidity sensor applications, were galvanostatically deposited at 40-60 \ufffdC on copper substrates. The deposition kinetics, studied up to a film thickness of about 20 [mu]m, was found to be linear and independent of deposition temperature. The observed film growth rate was in excellent agreement with the growth rates predicted from Faraday's law of electrolysis. The deposited films exhibited a preferred (200) orientation. The current-voltage characteristics of the electrodeposited Cu2O/Cu diodes exhibited a metal-insulator-semiconductor type of behaviour, suggesting the presence of a thin interfacial insulating layer between Cu2O and copper. The electrical conductivity of Cu2O films was found to vary exponentially with temperature in the 145-300\ufffdC range with an associated activation energy of 0.79 eV.",

In a second part, recent experimental evidence is described, which supports the idea that excitonic particles may form a highly quantum fluid. In Cu20, the analysis of the exciton decay spectrum shows a gradual evolution of the gas from a classical regime at low densities up to a strongly degenerate one at high densities, with a chemical potential \u00b5 ~ 0. In CuCl excitons are unstable against formation of molecules (biexcitons). It is possible to generate directly a high density gas of biexcitons with momentum K ~ 0 by giant two-photon absorption. At low excitation, the observed molecular emission is in agreement with Maxwell -Boltzmann statistics. At high densities, strong deviations occur. In particular, the appearance of a sharp emission line is attributed to the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate of excitonic molecules.",

Large changes in the intensity of the Cu PAES intensity resulting from isochronal in situ vacuum anneals made at increasing temperatures indicated that, before thermal treatment, the surface was completely covered by a carbonaceous overlayer and that this layer was removed, starting at a temperature between 100 and 200 \u00b0C, to expose an increasing amount of Cu in the top layer as the anneal temperature was increased. The thickness of this overlayer was estimated to be \u223c4 \u00c5 based on analysis of the EAES data, and its variation with the thermal anneal temperature was mapped. This study demonstrated the order-of-magnitude enhancement in the sensitivity of PAES to the topmost surface layer in Cu2O relative to the EAES counterpart; factors underlying this contrast are discussed. Finally, the implications of ultrathin carbon layers on semiconductor surfaces are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Thin films of copper oxide with thickness ranging from 0.05-0.45 [mu]m were deposited on microscope glass slides by successively dipping them for 20 s each in a solution of 1 M NaOH and then in a solution of copper complex. Temperature of the NaOH solution was varied from 50-90\ufffdC, while that of the copper solution was maintained at room temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the films, as prepared, are of cuprite structure with composition Cu2O. Annealing the films in air at 350\ufffdC converts these films to CuO. This conversion is accompanied by a shift in the optical band gap from 2.1 eV (direct) to 1.75 eV (direct). The films show p-type conductivity, ~5\ufffd10-4 [Omega]-1 cm-1 for a film of thickness 0.15 [mu]m. Electrical conductivity of this film increases by a factor of 3 when illuminated with 1 kW m-2 tungsten halogen radiation. Annealing in a nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures up to 400\ufffdC does not change the composition of the films. However, the conductivity in the dark as well as the photoconductivity of the film increases by an order of magnitude. The electrical conductivity of the CuO thin films produced by air annealing at 400\ufffdC, is high, 7\ufffd10-3 [Omega]-1 cm-1. These films are also photoconductive.",

The films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy. The thickness of the films is found to range from 16 nm to 20 \u03bcm. The domain structure with dimensions of 0.1--1 mm is found and attributed to single crystals oriented into different directions. The narrow peaks in rocking curves and in azimuthal angle rotations indicate the formation of highly oriented single-crystal films. Clear peaks due to yellow, green, blue, and violet excitons are observed in optical spectra. The positions of the peaks depend on the thickness of the film, implying strain-induced shifts of the exciton levels.",

The effect of internal reflections is also taken into account. The mean-free path of the relevant photons in the samples is estimated to be 1.4+/-0.4 mm. The resultant path length of the scattering photons becomes longer than the rectilinear length. This results in apparent three times larger absorption coefficient in off-axis geometry. This is found to be independent of the temperature in the range between 30 and 180 K, and of the photon energy in the region of the phonon-assisted exciton absorption edge associated with \u0393-3 phonons. The results of the simulation well reproduce the shape of absorbance, electroluminescence, and photovoltaic spectra.",

The X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the Cu2O composition of the films. Visible transmittance spectra of the cuprous oxide films were studied for the as-prepared, colored and bleached films. The cyclic voltammetry study showed that those films exhibited cathode coloring electrochromism, i.e. the films showed change of color from yellowish to black upon application of an electric field. The transmittance across the films for laser light of 670\u00c2\u00a0nm was found to change due to the voltage change for about 50%. The coloration memory of those films was also studied during 6\u00c2\u00a0h, ex-situ. The coloration efficiency at 670\u00c2\u00a0nm was calculated to be 37\u00c2\u00a0cm2/C.",

      "abstractNote": "The interaction of copper(II) oxide with aqueous ammonia containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H4L) is analyzed in terms of formal heterogeneous kinetics and the fractal dimension of the dissolving space. It is shown experimentally that, in the presence of H4L, the dissolution rate of CuO grows with increasing ammonia concentration. At a fixed ammonia concentration, the dissolution rate of CuO passes through a maximum at an H4L concentration of 8 \u00d7 10\u20133mol/l. Two mechanisms of dissolution are suggested, namely, an adsorption and a redox mechanism. The adsorption mechanism involves four intermediate species and implies that the dissolution rate is a fractional rational function of the EDTA concentration. The redox mechanism takes into account the oxide/electrolyte interfacial potential. The role of the CuOHL3\u2013ion is elucidated, and the kinetic parameters of dissolution are derived.",

Sometimes they form hydrogen like series which are in several compourids accompanied by vibration satellites. In anisotropic crystals the absorption lines are dichroic. These results are believed to give an experimental evidence for the existence of excitons.",

All the absorption edges and exciton lines appear in the photoconductivity spectrum as maxima or as minima. We have also studied, for the same sample, the photomagnetoelectrical effect. The photoconductivity spectra of others crystals were investigated : HgI2, PbI2, GaSe, CuCl. The same phenomena are observed.",

      "abstractNote": "The variation of the line width of the n = 1 line of the yellow series in Cu2O as a function of the concentration N of substitutional Ag+ ions (ref. 1) is interpreted on ground of a theory similar to the Lorentzian collision line broadening theory. It is shown that the line must acquire a Voigt shape when the concentration of Ag+ increases. This Voigt shape line is obtained from the convolution of a Gaussian component of a constant line width [Delta]vG = 0.57 cm-1 (obtained from the experiment by extrapolation to N --> 0) and a Lorentzian component of line width [Delta]vl variable with N. The shape of the experimental (ref. 1) lines for different concentrations N and the theoretical lines calculated is in surprinsingly good agreement. From this comparison a collision cross-section and mean free path of excitons can be calculated. The obtained values are [sigma] [reverse similar, equals] 1014 cm2 and XXX = 3.2 10-5 cm for a concentration N = 1018 cm-3. Further discussion of these results leads to useful information.",

The dispersion curve may be represented by a formula of the type [FORMULA] in terms of the two infra-red active frequencies ? 1 and ?2.

      "abstractNote": "The nonradiative recombination of an exciton due to a collision with another exciton (i.e., Auger recombination) is the dominant loss mechanism for excitons at high densities in photoexcited Cu2O. The principal evidence is that (a) the observed lifetime of excitons shortens substantially at high densities, and (b) the exciton density increases sublinearly with increasing excitation power. To achieve exciton densities at which this two-body decay process comes into play, the particles are produced within a few micrometers of the crystal surface using intense pulsed excitation with photon energies well above the semiconductor band gap. In the past, determination of the \u201cAuger constant\u201d A in the two-body decay rate, 1/\u03c4=An, was limited by insufficient knowledge of the exciton density n. In the present work, we have determined the density of excitons by (a) measuring their absolute brightness in a calibrated optical system and (b) measuring the expanding volume occupied by the excitons. The luminescence signal following subnanosecond laser excitation exhibits a decay rate which is strongly dependent on the particle density. While some modeling is required to determine the volumes at earliest times, we believe that we have determined the Auger constant to within a factor of 2. The experimental value, A=7\u00d710-17\u2002cm3/ns, is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that derived from spectroscopic analysis. Such a strong Auger decay prevents the gas from achieving average densities in the quantum statistical regime of an ideal gas.",

      "abstractNote": "An enclosed magnetic balance has been used to study the changes in magnetic susceptibility which take place during the oxidation of copper and during the treatment of cuprous and cupric oxides in oxygen and in vacuo. Cuprous oxide prepared by high temperature oxidation and cooled in vacuo from 1060 \u00b0C has a gram susceptibility of -0.155 x 10\u207b\u2076, independent of temperature in the range 14 to 293 \u00b0K. Cuprous oxide quenched from 1045 \u00b0C in air has a gram susceptibility which varies with temperature from \u03c7<sub>g</sub> = -0.150 x 10\u207b\u2076 at 293 \u00b0K to \u03c7<sub>g</sub> = -0.127 x 10\u207b\u2076 at 14 \u00b0K. The paramagnetic component of the susceptibility of the latter oxide is attributed to magnetic centres (cation vacancies and positive holes) arising from the oxygen excess, and its absolute value is compared with that expected from different models for the disorder. It is suggested that single vacancies aggregate on cooling. Cuprous oxide prepared by oxidation at low temperatures (120 to 160 \u00b0C) and low oxygen pressures may be rendered much more paramagnetic than the oxide prepared at high temperatures. A survey of the magnetic properties has been made by carrying out such oxidations in situ on the magnetic balance. It is concluded that beyond the stoichiometric point on the oxygen excess side an extensive metastable non-stoichiometry may be sustained at these temperatures. Further oxidation or, alternatively, a treatment in vacuo at a high temperature causes the oxygen excess to be nucleated and antiferromagnetic cupric oxide is formed. Similar studies with copper supported on silica show that the metastable paramagnetism is associated more especially with the surface. Attention is given to the fact that cupric oxide may be rendered paramagnetic under certain circumstances, but a distinction is drawn between this effect and the paramagnetism of non-stoichiometric cuprous oxide. The significance of the results for the mechanism of the oxidation of copper is discussed. It is suggested that CuO nucleates internally in Cu\u2082O, and a close analogy then exists between the oxidation of copper to Cu\u2082O and the oxidation of Cu\u2082O to CuO. The surface reaction, namely, incorporation of oxygen into cuprous oxide, is the same in both cases. A mechanism is put forward to account for the relative ease of cation vacancy production (and hence non-stoichiometry) in the surface layers during this process.",

The combined pressure and temperature dependence is log10 y=0.27 log10PO2\u2014(21.7 kcal) / RT+0.29 with T in \u00b0K and PO2 in mm Hg. This relation has been utilized to determine the extent of the cuprite field in the copper-oxygen system. The cation vacancy V+ is formed in Cu2O by the reaction \u00bcO2\u00bdO=+V. The entropy of formation of the vacancy, computed from S=S(O=)+S(V+)\u2212S(O2) is S(V+) = 12.1 cal deg\u20141. This positive entropy, caused by the lowering of the vibration frequencies of neighboring copper atoms, is the principal factor responsible for the defect structure of cuprous oxide. The new thermodynamic data lead to a quantitative determination of the diffusion parameters for copper in Cu2O.",

      "abstractNote": "Thermogravimetry (TGA) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) were employed to examine the oxidation behaviour of Cu. Thermogravimetry was used to study the oxidation behaviour of bulk Cu (99.9% purity) in the range 250 to 500\ufffdC. Within this temperature range the predominant oxidation product was cupric oxide (CuO) and the reaction followed a cubic rate law. The activation energy was calculated to be 71 kJ/mol. At lower temperatures (< 150\ufffdC) spectroscopic ellipsometry was employed to characterise the oxidation kinetics of as-deposited electroless and sputtered Cu films. Analysis of the experimental spectra indicated that the rate at which the oxide grew followed an inverse logarithmic rate law. The oxidation product, which had the typical ruby red hue of cuprous oxide (Cu2O), was confirmed as the predominant oxidation product with X-ray diffraction (XRD). The oxide scale which formed had very poor adhesion to the base material. Field emission electron microscopy (FEM) was used to examine the oxide scale topography. The low temperature product was seen to be composed of small, tightly packed grains approximately 60 nm in diameter whilst at temperatures above 300\ufffdC whisker-like crystals were also present.",

      "abstractNote": "It is demonstrated that cuprous oxide (Cu2O) can be electrodeposited epitaxially onto silicon (Si) and indium phosphide (InP) (001) single-crystalline substrates from aqueous solution. Epitaxial electrodeposition under these conditions is remarkable considering the strong driving force for the formation of amorphous native oxide layers on Si and InP substrates. To elucidate the growth mechanisms, the microstructure of the interfaces between the Cu2O layer and the two different substrates was investigated by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) in conjunction with XEDS (X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy) and EELS (electron energy-loss spectroscopy). In both heteroepitaxial systems, the Cu2O layers have a unique but non-trivial crystallographic orientation relationship (OR) with the substrate, which can be described as a 45\ufffd rotation around the common [001] axis representing the substrate normal. We show that this relationship minimizes the overall misfit between corresponding interatomic spacings of the two adjacent crystals. In apparent contradiction to the unique OR, TEM revealed that in both hetero-systems the Cu2O layer is separated from the substrate by an amorphous interlayer. The thickness of the interlayer typically is a few nanometers. The presence of an amorphous interlayer contrasts with our experimental results on electrodeposited Cu2O on Au (001) single-crystal substrates, also included in this article, where TEM shows the Cu2O epilayer in direct contact with the substrate. XEDS and EELS analysis of the chemical composition and bonding at Cu2O/Si and Cu2O/InP interfaces in the as-grown state as well as after tempering revealed that the interlayer is mainly composed of SiO2 and InPO4, respectively. Most likely, the observed epitaxial layers on top of an amorphous interlayer evolve by nucleation of epitaxial Cu2O directly on the substrate. While simultaneous oxidation of the substrate leads to the formation of an amorphous layer, the epitaxial nuclei can laterally overgrow the oxide. Consequently, the local composition of the amorphous layer varies with the nature of the substrate.",

Oxygen partial pressures lower than 10\u22125 atm hav e been obtained either by the partial vacuum technique, the opening of an adjustable leak being tied to the response of an electrochemical gauge placed near the sample, or under a total pressure of 1 atm, the oxygen partial pressure in argon being lowered by passing through an electrochemical pump. The electrical conductivity values, obtained for oxygen partial pressures lower than 10\u22125 atm, are in agreement with those measured at higher oxygen partial pressures, using a classical method for obtaining PO2. The results obtained may be explained assuming the existence of interactions among defects leading to the formation of complex associates of the type (V'CuVxCu). At lower PO2, the values of the slope 1/n= (\u2202ln\u03c3/\u2202lnPO2)T, lower than 1/8, may be explained by impurity effects or by the prevailing influence of interstitial copper defects.",

By monitoring the intensity of the latter, we find that Cu2O formation depends strongly on the surface temperature and on the O2 pressure and is kinetically limited by the impinging O2 flux. Thermally activated step roughening, leading to detachment of Cu adatoms from the step edge, acts as a source of mobile Cu atoms, allowing for subsequent nucleation of Cu2O patches.",

By the fitting a value of 123.2 K is obtained for the Debye temperature, in contrast to the values of 180 to 190 K reported from other experiments. Then, a measure of covalency of the Cu-O bond is also calculated to be smaller by a factor of five than another measure of covalency calculated from the resonance frequency. These are attributed to the lattice instability and inappropriate value of the repulsive range parameter. It is concluded that the first-order Raman process due to covalency contributes significantly to the relaxation in Cu2O.",

I-V characteristics are explained very well with n-values typically greater than 2. As a result, it appears that Cu/Cu2O cells have a MIS structure. C-V data also imply a MIS configuration. Solar cell calculations have been carried out for Cu2O devices based on a MIS model.

As a result, a copper- rich layer appearc to exist at the Cu20 interface in these Schottky barriers formed with low work function metals. On the other hand, the Au/Cu20 interface exhibits a'more \"normal\" structure. These results are utilized to explain the rel- atively low barrier heights obtained for Cu20 Schottky barriers, and the apparent \"efficiency plateau\" of 1% for Cu20 solar cells. The results are also compatible with the fact that Au forms essentially an ohmic contact on Cu,O.",

Cu/Cu2O cells were develope that exhibited active-area air mass 1 values of photocurrent and efficiency of 8.5 mA cm\u22122 and 1.8% respectively. A detailed photon and carrier loss analysis conducted for Cu/Cu2O cells is used to project the ultimate values of the photocurrent for Cu2O cells to be 12 \u2013 14 mA cm\u22122. Thermodynamic considerations indicate that thallium is the only metal which can be combined with Cu2O to yield an adequate efficiency. However, Tl/Cu2O Schottky barrier cells exhibit properties similar to Cu/Cu2O devices. Depth-concentration profiles show that, although no Tl---O bonding exists in the interfacial region, the region is copper rich. It is concluded that the oxygen deficiency occurs because of preferential sputtering of oxygen during the thallium deposition process. As a result of these Cu2O Schottky barrier studies, it is concluded that significant improvements in the efficiency of Cu2O solar cells can be achieved only with a homojunction structure. Thus, an approach to doping Cu2O n type must be developed in order for the potential of this material for low cost photovoltaics to be realized.",

Because of the high photon energies and effective background subtraction, our data give a clear picture of the bulk band structure. The results confirm the existence of a hybridized Cu 3d\u2013Cu 4s state located between the two main Cu 3d and O 2p band regions. Several theoretical studies have predicted the existence of this band, but until now it has not been detected in any photoemission measurements. The experimentally derived band structure is compared to local density approximation calculations with and without the Hubbard potential U. The clear band dispersion in our experimental data has enabled us to extract a refined Hubbard U value, which makes it possible to achieve a better agreement between theoretically calculated bands and experimental data.",

      "abstractNote": "Thin films of CuO and Cu2O were deposited from CuI as the copper source and O2 or N2O as the oxygen source. If O2 was used, both CuO and Cu2O were obtained. Cu2O was deposited at low O2 partial pressures (Po2 < 0.2 Torr) in a long isothermal hot wall chemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactor (T=500 \ufffdC). The CuO phase was obtained at a certain position in the CVD reactor and a sudden maximum in the deposition rate was then reached. The maximum was attributed to a change in the deposition mechanism upon the formation of CuO. When I2 was added to the reaction gas mixture, the maximum disappeared and the deposition rate increased. The formation of CuO was also investigated thermodynamically. For higher [I2]/[CuI] ratios, the CuO phase was stable, even at a low O2 pressure. Cu2O films were also deposited with N2O as the oxygen source. At 650 \ufffdC and with an excess of CuI, the deposition rate was found to be controlled by the decomposition of N2O. Above a linear gas flow velocity of 70 cm s-1, the deposition rate was constant, which indicated a surface-controlled process.",

Auger surface analysis showed evidence of copper metal at the interface, arising from chemical reactions. For a CdO/Cu2O junction formed at room temperature, no copper metal was found at the interface. The CdO/Cu2O cells showed Voc = 0.4 V and Isc = 2 mA cm\u22122.

From space charge limited current (SCLC), Hall effect and DLTS measurements it is demonstrated that there is a trap-band distribution with the Fermi level lying within the trap-band. The maximum of this trap-band distribution is just above the Fermi level. A theoretical model is introduced to explain this trap-band distribution. Annealing of the samples in air at 400\u2013500\u00b0C for 5 h gives the lowest total trap concentration and the lowest resistivity of the material. The above annealing decreases the total number of traps by a factor of 3 compared to the as grown samples. The resistivity decreases also by at least one order of magnitude.",

From photoluminescence and C-V (admittance spectroscopy) measurements it is demonstrated that in the energy gap of the undoped material there are deep traps at the energy levels 0.72, 1.19 and 1.33 eV from the valence band edge. Annealing of the samples in air at 500\u00b0C for 5 h decreases the concentration of the traps 1.19 and 1.33 eV, by a factor of 50. The origin of these two trap levels is singly and doubly ionized oxygen vacancies which are partially filled with the annealing. Doping with Cd decreases the trap concentration of these two trap levels by a factor of 7 and annealing of the doped material at 500\u00b0C in air removes completely these two trap levels. However, in the Cd-doped material a new trap appears at the energy level 0.90 eV from the valence band edge.",

The DLTS spectra are due to acceptor states distributed in energy and their origin is attributed to structural anomalies and \u201cislands\u201d of CuO in the material. The analysis, based on a weak disordered Gaussian distribution of the acceptor states, gives real values of the activation energy E0 and the capture cross section, which are smaller than the ones determined from standard DLTS analysis. A small deviation from the Gaussian distribution was observed for temperatures higher than the one corresponding to the peak of the DLTS signal. This is attributed to a small assymetry of the trap-band distribution with respect to the maximum of the trap-band. The maximum concentration of the trap-band distribution is located above the Fermi level. The above observations are true only for a sample which was annealed at 500\u00b0C in air. The assymetry of the trap-band distribution is quite large for a sample annealed at 400\u00b0C. First results are presented and the need for a new model is emphasized for this case.",

Thermogravimetric copper oxidation was studied in air and oxygen at temperatures between 350 and 1000\u00b0C. From the temperature dependence of the oxidation rates, three different processes can be identified for the oxidation of copper: bulk diffusion, grain-boundary diffusion, and surface control with whisker growth; these occur at high, intermediate, and low temperatures, respectively. Electrical-conductivity measurements as a function of temperature (350\u20131134\u00b0C) and oxygen partial pressure (10\u20138\u20131.0 atm) indicate intrinsic electronic conduction in CuO over the entire range of conditions. Electronic behavior of nonstoichiometric Cu2O indicates that the charge defects are doubly-ionized oxygen interstitials and holes. The calculated enthalpy of formation of oxygen ( ) and hole-conduction energy (EH) at constant composition for nonstoichiometric Cu2O are 2.0\u00b10.2 eV and 0.82\u00b10.02 eV, respectively.",

While no surface segregation of phosphorus was observed on samples cleaned by ion bombardment and annealing in ultrahigh vacuum, the presence of large amounts of phosphorus was found after the formation of the oxide by exposure to 0.1 Torr oxygen at 770 K. The surface enrichment in P with the same binding energy was found after annealing a sheet of DHP copper coated with a layer of Cu2O deposited by sputtering. The binding energy of the P 2p peak as well as the analysis of the components of O 1s can be interpreted with the formation of a metaphosphate. Experiments performed at intermediate temperatures showed that the segregation of phosphorus is appreciable above 600 K and appears to be related to oxygen diffusion into the bulk.",

The oxygen-partial-pressure and temperature dependencies of D*Cu suggest that both neutral and singly charged copper vacancies contribute to cation self-diffusion. A defect model involving both neutral and singly charged copper vacancies, electron holes, and singly charged oxygen-interstitial ions is developed and fit to the tracer-diffusion data, the electrical-conductivity data (Maluenda et al.), and the stoichiometry data (O'Keeffe and Moore). The resulting defect data are quantitatively consistent with the chemical-diffusion data (Maluenda et al.) and with a correlation factor . The defect data are also quantitatively consistent with the high-temperature oxidation studies of copper metal (Iguchi et al.) and with the copper vacancy being 10 times more mobile than the oxygen-interstitial ion at 1000\u2020C.",

The films are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, four-point probe method and UV-Vis spectrometry. The three defined compounds in the Cu---O binary system can be deposited by varying the oxygen flow rate introduced into the reactor. All the films are crystallized with a mean crystal size ranging from 10 to about 35 nm. They are highly resistive and present a direct optical band gap higher than 2 eV. The application of a bias voltage during the deposition phase modifies the texture of the Cu2O films and also induces a preferential resputtering of oxygen from the Cu4O3 ones. This resputtering phenomenon leads firstly to the occurrence of the cuprite phase mixed with the paramelaconite one and secondly to the amorphisation of the films. Finally, the thermal stability in air of cuprite, paramelaconite and tenorite films has been investigated. The results show that the stability of Cu2O and Cu4O3 films in air is influenced by the thickness and/or the texture of the films. Tenorite films with a low optical band gap (1.71 eV) can be formed after air annealing at 350 \u00b0C of an unbiased cuprite film.",

For samples equilibrated well within the region of Cu2O stability, conduction was governed by an acceptor level at 0.4 eV above the valence band as determined from the temperature dependence of the Hall effect. The presence of two minority carrier trapping levels was also established and trapping parameters were determined from an analysis of the transient photoconductivity. The 0.4\u2212eV acceptor level was also found to be present in a sample equilibrated under conditions placing its composition in a region near the CuO\u2212Cu2O phase boundary. For this sample, however, only a single deeper trapping level was observed. A third type of sample, equilibrated under conditions which placed its composition in a region near the Cu\u2212Cu2O phase boundary, was characterized by both a high hole density and a high mobility with an acceptor level energy of 0.16 eV. Also, the presence of two effects, the thermal quenching of the steady\u2212state photoconductivity and its nonlinear dependence on light intensity, were shown to be consistent with the presence of deep traps in this material.",

The y\u2212PO2\u2212T relations are analyzed in order to identify the dominant point defects. It is found that in the high PO2 range of the phase, the dominant defects are neutral copper vacancies, VxCu. In the low PO2 range there are two types of defects, dominating at different temperatures. At low temperatures the dominant defects are neutral copper interstitials, Cuxi. The analysis indicates that at temperatures higher than 1245 K the dominant defects are oxygen vacancies, VxO. The enthalpy and entropy for the formation of VCux and Cuix are also determined.",

The hole mobility is 3 , vh 6 cm2/Vs, and it decreases when the temperature increases. The electron mobility is higher than that of holes, with values of 150 ve 200 cm2/Vs.

An abrupt decrease in reaction rate after complete consumption of metal phase but long before reaching equilibrium has been observed. This phenomenon is connected to an irregular character of the development of the reaction diffusion zone. In contrast to the usually applied layer model, initially formed oxide layers separate into numerous aggregates of Cu2O crystals chaotically scattered throughout the zone between thinner layers of CuO grains. Such fragmentation of the diffusion zone is induced by macro- and microcracks formed in copper scale under influence of mechanical stresses at metal-oxide phase boundary due to the difference in molar volume between copper and its oxides. The pattern of cracks provides channels of fast diffusion and maintains the reaction rate at high level but only until the source of crack formation remains in action.",

      "abstractNote": "Amorphous copper oxide films were deposited using the SILAR technique. Both Cu 2 O and CuO crystallographic phases exist in deposited and annealed films. Crystallization and growth processes by annealing at temperatures up to 823 K form grains with nano- and micro-spherical shapes. The calculated crystallite size from the XRD measurement was found to be in the range 14\u201321 nm while nano-spheres in the diameter range 50\u2013100 nm were observed by SEM micrographs. The band gap for amorphous film was found to be 2.3 eV which increased slowly to 2.4 eV by annealing the film at 373 K. This was explained by defect redistribution in amorphous films. Annealing in the temperature range 373\u2013673 K decreased the band gap gradually to 1.85 eV. The decrease of the band gap with annealing temperature in the range 373\u2013673 K agrees well with the Brus model of the energy gap confinement effect in nanostructured semiconducting materials. Annealing in the temperature range 673\u2013823 K decreases the band gap slowly to 1.7 eV due to the smaller contribution of the confinement effect. Below 573 K, Cu 2 O is the most probable crystalline phase in the film, while Cu 2 O and CuO crystalline phases may coexist at annealing temperatures above 573 K due to further oxidation of Cu 2 O. A wider transmittance spectral window in the visible region was obtained by controlling the annealing conditions of the amorphous copper oxide film and its applicability to the window layer of solar cell was suggested.",

It is shown that despite the economic prospects of efficient cells based on Cu2O, little is known about the photovoltaic properties of this material when it is fabricated by low-temperature techniques.

The p\u2010type conductivity, its temperature dependence, and its thermostimulated characteristics can be explained by assuming that a pair of deep levels (acceptor and donor type) control the electrical properties of these films. A novel thermostimulated conductivity model is introduced to include the effect of impurity conduction. Impurity conduction through the acceptor\u2010type level is the dominant transport mechanism at temperatures below approximately 200 K. The experimental results on thermostimulated conductivity measurements reveal the effect of Poole\u2013Frenkel lowering of the ionization energy of the acceptor\u2010type deep level. For a typical sample the zero\u2010field ionization energy of this level is 0.792 eV. Having a concentration of 5\u00d71013 cm\u22123 and a hole capture cross section of 3.12\u00d710\u22129 cm2, this level is compensated with a donor\u2010type level of unknown ionization energy having a concentration of 1.89\u00d71013 cm\u22123. Impurity conduction in this sample shows an activation energy of 0.03 eV before and 0.08 eV after a sample is illuminated at 77 K. From the measurement of the Poole\u2013Frenkel constant the electron affinity of the film is obtained to be 2.9 eV.",

Some preliminary photoelectrical properties of two devices with semitransparent aluminum and gold top-electrodes have been measured. The device with a gold top-electrode exhibits a weak photovoltaic effect and a space charge limited current conduction mechanism in dark. The other device which had been annealed before the deposition of the aluminum top-electrode, exhibits a three-fold increase in resistivity and a marked difference in its temperature dependence of conductivity. From the temperature dependence of conductivity, two activation energies of 0.09 and 0.87 eV could be measured compared to 0.11 and 0.26 eV for the device with a gold electrode. Photoinduced current transient spectroscopy with a novel approach to the post-capture data analysis (additive double gate analysis) has been used in detection and the measurements of the parameters of several deep energy levels. These levels have activation energies in the range of 0.12 to 0.63 eV and capture cross-sections in the range of 10\u221222 to 10\u221212 cm2. Using the role of the sample bias polarity on the identification of the type of the traps, one electron trap (surface state) and one hole trap (bulk state) could be identified among the five detected deep levels.",

Model calculations were performed for a range of metal/oxide systems (oxidation of Al, Ni, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mg, Zr and Ti) on the basis of the sum of the surface, interfacial and bulk energy differences between the competing amorphous and crystalline oxide overgrowths on the same metal substrate. It follows that an amorphous state for the initial oxide overgrowth can be thermodynamically (instead of kinetically) preferred as long as the higher bulk Gibbs energy of the amorphous oxide overgrowth is overcompensated for by its low sum of surface and interface energies. The dominating factors, which thermodynamically favour the formation of an amorphous oxide overgrowth, are exposed and discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Transparent thin films of copper(I) oxide prepared on conductive SnO2/F glass substrates by anodic oxidation of sputtered copper films or by direct electrodeposition of Cu2O transformed reversibly to opaque metallic copper films when reduced in alkaline electrolyte. In addition, the same Cu2O films transform reversibly to black copper(II) oxide when cycled at more anodic potentials. Copper oxide-to-copper switching covered a large dynamic range, from 85 to 10% photopic transmittance, with a coloration efficiency of about 32 cm2/C. Gradual deterioration of the switching range occurred over 20-100 cycles. This is tentatively ascribed to coarsening of the film and contact degradation caused by the 65% volume change on conversion of Cu to Cu2O. Switching between the two copper oxides (which have similar volumes) was more stable and more efficient (CE=60 cm2/C), but covered a smaller transmittance range (60-44% T). Due to their large electrochemical storage capacity and tolerance for alkaline electrolytes, these cathodically coloring films may be useful as counter electrodes for anodically coloring electrode films such as nickel oxide or metal hydrides.",

A Cu-target was sputtered in rf-mode by an oxygen/argon plasma, and the influence of the oxygen partial pressure on composition, structure, texture and morphology of the Cu-O layers was investigated. The analysis with EPMA, XRD, HEED and SEM yielded the following results: with an appropriate setting of the oxygen partial pressure, the oxygen content of the films could be controlled between 0 and 50 at-%. XRD bulk structure analysis shows changes in the crystal structure of the films with increasing oxygen content from the fcc structure of Cu, followed by the sc structure of Cu2O (cuprite), the tetragonal structure of Cu3 2+Cu2 1+O4 (paramelaconite) to the monoclinic structure of CuO (tenorite). As revealed by HEED, the structure of the near-surface region of the latter two is the same as that of the bulk, whereas in the case of the films with fcc bulk structure, due to oxidation by air, the surface has the sc structure of Cu2O, and in the case of the film with the sc structure, a monoclinic surface structure of CuO is observed. SEM analyses detected a disordered columnar growth of all Cu-O films.",

However, this technique has some experimental difficulties which may render the results useless. These difficulties are discussed and examples are presented. A new method is presented, which is denoted as the \"zero driving force\" technique. In this method the electronic current is eliminated by short circuiting, thus eliminating the driving force acting on the electrons/holes. This new technique does not suffer from the drawbacks of the polarization method. It is shown that MIEC probes can be used to transfer and information. Two voltemeters connected to MIEC probes applied to an MIEC sample can be used to measure and . This measurement is simultaneous and refers to the same two contact points.

      "abstractNote": "Semiconductors with mobile donors and acceptors are mixed-ionic-electronic-conductors, MIECs, which exhibit peculiar electronic (electron/hole), I e , current-voltage relations. This is a result of the redistribution of the ions under the applied electrical potential. MIECs are usually ionic materials which exhibit relative low electron/hole mobilities as compared to the materials used in the semiconductor industry. However, thin layers of MIECs exhibit a low resistance and fast response and become of increasing interest. The I e \u2212V relations are discussed for a few typical examples. It is shown that they depend on the energy band gap as when it is large, the semiconductor is either p-type or n-type. The I e \u2212V relations depend also on the nature of the electrodes, whether blocking for ion exchange or not. Experimental results for Cu2O are presented and analyzed using one of the models discussed.",

The films cycled in K+-based electrolyte revealed typical red-ox peaks with higher intensity compared to those in the Li+ and the Na+-based electrolytes. The durability of the cuprous oxide due to cycling into LiClO4 was about 60 cycles. The thermal treatment of the films invoked decrease in red-ox peak intensity, and thus deterioration in the electrochromic properties. The response time of the coloration and bleaching to an abrupt voltage change from -4.5 to +4.5\ufffdV and reverse was found to be in the range of about 10\ufffds. The maximum light intensity modulation ability of the films, as the AM1.5 spectrum is taken for an input, was calculated to be about 65%.",

Though these devices have been known for almost 80 years they are still not fully understood. The standard interpretation of these I\u2013V relations is by assuming Schottky barriers to exist between a metal electrode and the oxide. We here report on a new form of I\u2013V relations that we have measured for devices based on thin films of Cu2O. Their interpretation calls upon mixed ionic electronic conduction in the oxide. The ionic conductivity, though low, is sufficient to allow a redistribution of the native acceptors on the time scale of the measurements, thereby affecting the electronic current carried by holes. Any contribution to the I\u2013V relations from Schottky barriers is not significant.",

This paper presents experimental results for solid state devices based on copper oxide, found to be Cu2O, which exhibit these I-V relations. The cells examined are Cu| Cu2O| In and Cu| Cu2O| Ag and similar ones tested at room temperature. The measured I-V relations are different from those reported for the same type of cells in the past, which were explained to be fixed by a Schottky barrier Cu| Cu2O. We find that the I-V relations relax over a long time which we claim is due to ion redistribution. The new I-V relations can then be explained by assuming that Cu2O is a mixed-ionic-electronic-conductor and adopting a theory developed by us in the past and modified to be applicable to the relevant defect model here. In this case the contribution of Schottky barriers is insignificant.",

The coupling between excitons is due to interaction between the gradient of electric field induced by the DCM2 Frenkel exciton (FE) and the quadrupole moment of the 1S transition in the cuprous oxide. The specific choice of the organic allows us to use the mechanism of \u201csolid state solvation\u201d [C. Madigan and V. Bulovic, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 247403 (2003)] to dynamically tune the WE and FE into resonance for \u22483.3ns (comparable with the big lifetime of the WE) of the \u201cslow\u201d phase of the solvation. The quadrupole-dipole hybrid utilizes the big oscillator strength of the FE, along with the big lifetime of the quadrupole exciton, unlike dipole-dipole hybrid exciton which utilizes the big oscillator strength of the FE and big radius of the dipole allowed WE. Due to the strong spatial dispersion and big mass of the quadrupole WE, the hybridization is not masked by the kinetic energy or the radiative broadening. The lower branch of the hybrid dispersion exhibits a pronounced minimum and may be used in applications. Also, we investigate and report noticeable change in the coupling due to an induced \u201cStark effect\u201d from the strong local electric field of the FE. We investigated the fine energy structure of the quantum well confined ortho and para excitons in cuprous oxide.",

The Frenkel molecular exciton of the DCM2 is brought into resonance with the 1S quadrupole Wannier Mott exciton in the cuprous oxide by \u201csolvatochromism\u201d with CA. The resulting hybrid is thermalized with the surrounding helium bath. This leads to strongly non-linear temperature dependence of the laser field detuning from the quadrupole exciton energy band which is associated with the temperature-induced red shift of the Wannier exciton energy. A numerical up- and down-scan for the detuning reveals hysteresis-like temperature distribution. The obtained multiple bi-stability regions are at least three orders of magnitude bigger (meV) than the experimentally observed bi-stability in bulk cuprous oxide (\u03bceV ). The effective absorption curve exhibits highly asymmetrical behavior for the Frenkel-like (above the 1S energy) and Wannier-like (below the 1S energy) branches of the hybrid.",

These conditions are achieved by connecting the oxidizing copper covered with an initially formed thin oxide film to the positive and negative terminal of a dc source, respectively. However, the influence of direction of the current is found to be opposite under uninterrupted mode of impressed current flow in the same temperature range. The effect of short-circuiting the metal to the outer oxide/air interface on the reaction kinetics is also reported. The rate of oxide-scale growth under normal condition, and two different modes of current applications as well as with shorting circuitry attachment conform to the parabolic growth law. The results pertaining to the two different modes of impressed current have been discussed considering both the phenomena of electrolysis of the oxide electrolyte and the polarization at the two phase boundaries. The enhancement and the reduction in rates under uninterrupted impressed current conditions are explained on the basis of increased and decreased average defect concentrations, respectively, within the oxide layer. The acceleration and deceleration in the rates under interrupted mode of current flow have been explained in the light of sustenance of a steeper and flatter electrochemical-potential gradient of defects, respectively, across the growing-oxide layer. The possible different responses of the metal/oxide and oxide/air interfaces to the impressed current brought into play by two different modes of current application, have enabled to display a better insight on the mechanistic aspects of scale growth under the influence of an externally applied current.",

      "abstractNote": "The kinetics of copper oxidation under theinfluence of an externally-supplied static charge ofeither kind at one of the reaction interfaces of agrowing oxide film on its subsequent thickening weredetermined in the temperature range of 523-1173 K andoxygen-pressure range of 5.06-50.66 kPa. The kineticsconformed to the parabolic rate law under all conditionsof experimentation. In the temperature range of 523-723 K, charge supply of either kind ateither of the oxide interfaces, reduced the ratescompared to normal oxidation. The reduction in rates ismore pronounced with (-)ve charge supply. In thistemperature range, Mott's in situ electrical-potentialgradient across the oxide film is identified as thepredominant driving force for migration of copper ionsduring the subsequent film-thickening process. On the other hand, in the temperature range of 873-973K, a charge supply of either kind enhanced the ratescompared to normal oxidation, where Wagner'selectrochemical-potential gradient acts as the maindriving force for ion diffusion. However, at 1073 K and1173 K, the rates were found to decrease slightlycompared to normal oxidation. The oxygen-pressuredependencies of rate constants at 623 K exhibitedrelations of the type kP ?PO21/4 for normal and kp ?PO21/8 (approximately) for oxidation witheither (+)ve or (-)ve charge supply at the oxide/oxygeninterface. However, at 873 K the oxygen-pressuredependencies of rate constants conform to kP ?PO21/6 for normal as well as for oxidationwith either (+)ve or (-)ve charge supply at theoxide/oxygen interface. The estimated activationenergies are 54 kJ/mol and 160 kJ/mol in Mott's and Wagner's parabolic ranges,respectively. It is established that migration of Cu+ions through the growing film is the rate-limiting stepunder all conditions of experimentation. This study has clearly demonstrated that changes inoxidation rates can be brought about by disturbing theinterfacial defect equilibria with anexternally-supplied static charge when no net currentflows through the oxide film. The estimated self-diffusivityvalues of Cu+ ions in the growingCu2O at 873 K are also reported.",

To check the quality of the calculated electron density, static structure factors and Compton profiles have been calculated, showing a good agreement with the available experimental data. The effective electron and hole masses have been evaluated for Cu2O at the center of the Brillouin zone. The calculated interaction energy between the two interpenetrated frameworks in the cuprite structure is estimated to be around -6.0 kcal/mol per Cu2O formula.

In this article, the electronic structure of acceptor-forming defects in Cu2O, namely, copper vacancies and oxygen interstitials, is investigated using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA corrected for on-site Coulombic interactions (GGA+U). GGA produces notionally semimetallic defect complexes, which is not consistent with the experimentally known polaronic nature of conduction in Cu2O. GGA+U also predicts a semimetallic defect complex for the \u201csimple\u201d copper vacancy but predicts the \u201csplit\u201d vacancy and both oxygen interstitials are characterized by localized polarons, with distinct single particle levels found in the band gap. For both methods, however, the positions of calculated transition levels are inconsistent with experimental ionization levels. Hence neither GGA nor GGA+U are successful in modeling p-type defects in Cu2O.",

The possibility that this \"photomemory\" effect is due to electron trapping was investigated by methods analogous to thermally stimulated conductivity. When the preilluminated samples are heated at a constant rate with time, = dT/dt = constant, the plots of excess conductance vs. temperature are characterized by two maxima lying at about 25\u00b0 and 100\u00b0C. Under different heating rates, the temperatures of the maxima, Tm, are shifted according to the function In (Tm2/) = Et/kTm + constant. The values of Et obtained are interpreted as indicating traps lying 1.03 and 1.34 eV below the conduction band, with a precision of \u00b115%.",

The Cu-O liquid phase is represented by the two-sublattice model for ionic liquids containing copper on the cation sublattice with formal valences of Cu+1, Cu+2, and Cu+3. The presence of Cu+3 ions in the liquid phase, corresponding to a formation of Cu2O3 species, was the key assumption of this model. Congruent melting of CuO at 1551 K under an oxygen pressure of \u223c126.8 MPa is predicted, which is considerably below previous theoretical values.",

The nonpolar (111) surface can be prepared in a nearly stoichiometric (1\u00d71) form by ion bombardment and annealing in vacuum. Oxygen adsorbs molecularly on the stoichiometric (111) surface at 300 K, but adsorbs dissociatively on a defective (111) surface prepared by ion bombardment. For the polar Cu2O(100) face it was possible to prepare a reconstructed, Cu-terminated surface with a (3\u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2 )R45\u00b0 periodicity by ion bombardment and annealing in vacuum. Preparation of an unreconstructed, (1\u00d71), O-terminated (100) surface was possible by large (109-L) oxygen exposures. UPS investigations of the O-terminated (100) surface suggest a mixture of incorporated (i.e., lattice) oxygen and adsorbed atomic oxygen (i.e., adatoms) in the terminating layer. The annealing behavior of the Cu2O(100) surface was history dependent. Early in the sample history, bulk lattice oxygen diffused to the surface at temperatures above 800 K giving domains of (\u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2 )R45\u00b0 periodicity associated with half a terminating layer of oxygen atoms. After repeated ion bombardment and annealing cycles, heating above 800 K gave only a Cu-terminated surface, apparently because of a depletion of bulk lattice oxygen.",

Furthermore, the linewidths increase and the continuum overlaps the line spectra with increasing concentration of impurities.

The indium tin oxide (ITO) layers have good optical transmissions (more than 85%) and high electrical conductivities (approximately 3\ufffd103 [Omega]-1 cm-1). ITO/Cu2O front cells were studied for their photovoltaic properties in view of their possible applications as solar cells. Preliminary studies give 1.0-1.25 eV for the barrier height and indicate that short-circuit current densities of several milliamp\ufffdres per square centimetre (under air mass 1 illumination) can easily be attained.",

      "abstractNote": "In view of their possible application in solar energy conversion, cuprous oxide films have been investigated. Such films have been grown on copper substrates to a thickness of a few micrometers, using both thermal and anodic oxidation techniques. The photovoltaic properties of the resulting Cu2O/Cu backwell cells are found to depend critically on the copper surface preparation, as well as on the specific conditions of oxidation. Backwall cells of the thermal variety with thicknesses down to 3 [mu]m do not quite yet approach the performance of the best Cu2O front cells, but are much simpler to grow. Serious difficulties with shorting paths in the case of thermally grown oxide and with the purity of the Cu2O in the anodic case will have to be solved before a solar cell with an oxide layer thickness in the 1.5 to 2 [mu]m range can be produced.",

In order to complete the fabrication of the Au/CuO/Cu 2 O/Cu sandwich structure a gold metal contact was then applied on the cupric oxide layer under the pressure of 1 \u00d7 10 -6 Torr. The current-voltage characteristics and effective capacitance of the sandwich structure were measured in various humidity ranges at a temperature 20 \u00b0C. It was observed that the electronic conduction and capacitance of the Au/CuO/Cu 2 O/Cu structure were strongly dependent on humidity.

It was observed that the capacitance of the Cu/Cu 2 O/Au structure was significantly dependent on both wavelength and intensity of the light.

However, some minor differences with earlier results were also observed, which are concentrated on a mainly oxygen-related feature. The important first ionization state is much better resolved in our high-resolution XPS data, and is found to have both copper and oxygen orbital character. This is consistent (though not a proof) with the theoretical prediction that the first ionization state is a 1A1g singlet with holes on both oxygen and copper sites. The 16-eV satellite is found to show a Cu antiresonance, and is assigned to a 1A1g singlet with both holes on the copper sites.",

When the exciton density is low, the observed luminescence is found to originate from a nonequilibrium excitonic gas where the exciton-LA phonon scattering dominates. When the exciton density is very high, not only the exciton-LA phonon scattering but also the exciton-exciton scattering is important. The observed luminescence consists of two systems: one is from an exciton system that is distributed according to the usual Bose-Einstein statistics with chemical potential \u03bc=0, while the other is from excitons with zero kinetic energy. The two systems were found to be in thermal equilibrium. The latter system might be a form of Bose-Einstein condensation.",

Both the modulating voltage Uac and the dc bias voltage Udc were varied. The electro-reflectance structure obtained is due to the electric field effect on the n = 1 and n = 2 exciton lines of the blue and violet exciton series of cuprous oxide. The inversion of the electro-reflectance structure occurs for some values of the ac voltage being different for various dc biases. This phenomenon is due to the presence of surface band bending of Cu2O samples investigated. Agreement was obtained with the basic conclusions of Aspnes and Frova's theory taking into account the influence of the surface field non-uniformity on the line-shapes of the electro-reflectance spectra.",

On the basis of the theory of carrier-lattice interactions in polyatomic crystals the intrinsic scattering mechanisms of this substance have been clarified, for the first time, in a wide temperature range up to 400 K. From 40 K to 100 K scattering is dominated by the low-frequency LO phonon, \u03c91. Above 100 K, the effect of the high-frequency LO phonon, \u03c92, becomes remarkable. Here, \u03c91=153 cm-1 and \u03c92=660 cm-1 at 4.2 K. Mobility quenching due to the metastable self-trapping of holes possibly underlies the phenomena above 200 K. Below 40 K, the temperature dependence of mobility can be explained in terms of a combination of the effects of optical, acoustical and neutral impurity scatterings. The magnitude of the deformation potential of the + valence band is estimated to be as small as 0.7\u00b10.3 eV.",

The growth kinetic effects and influence of the RPP temperature on the chemical deposited cuprous oxide thin films microstructures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. The effect of the electrical resistivity change of Cu2O thin film layer in the presence of NO2 is used for gas sensing measurements. Cuprous oxide layers are used as NO2 gas sensitive material in a novel gas sensor element. It can be shown from experimental results that chemical bath deposition and rapid photothermal processing not only allows green materials preparation but also improves the performance and reliability over conventional methods of the production of sensors for continuous environmental monitoring.",

For the elements Mn and Co, magnetic exchange constants up to the fifth nearest neighbor are calculated, assuming both cases, perfect Mn/Co:Cu2O as well as defects in the host such as single copper and oxygen vacancies.

      "abstractNote": "An optical spectrometer may be a tool unfamiliar to an outsider of the optics community. It can be regarded as a natural evolution of the way we perceive the surrounding environment. Light coming from the sun is reflected or transmitted by objects. The human eye, by measuring this reflected or transmitted light, gains some information about the objects themselves, such as their color, brightness, and shape. Using the same principles, an optical spectrometer is designed to gain even more information. It has a source of light used to send light on some objects, and a hi-tech detector to measure the transmitted or reflected light. After the material has been measured, a relation needs to be established between its optical response and its main physical properties. In this thesis we consider the case of solid state materials. These are materials where the atoms are in close proximity to each other, and arranged in repetitive patterns on macroscopic distances, to make a compact structures (a good example is NaCl, kitchen salt). To establish the above mentioned relation the following procedure is followed. First the optical response (transmission, reflectivity, absorption, etc.) at each frequency in the incident light is measured. The result in quantified in terms of the so called dielectric constant of the bulk \u03b5(\u221e). In a second step, this function is related to the main physical propertied of the measured solid state material, using the knowledge of this particular structure, determined before by different type of measurements, such as for instance X-ray diffraction. Today, optical spectroscopy has become one of the most important standard tools for investigating novel condensed matter materials.\n\nThe aim of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate the low energy excitation spectra and the (induced) phase transitions in transition metal oxides.",

Effects of annealing in air have been studied using the above mentioned methods. As-deposited cuprous oxide exhibits a direct band gap of 2.0 eV, and shows an n-type behaviour when used in an liquid/solid junction. Annealing below 300\u00b0C enhances the n-type photocurrent produced by the junction. Type conversion occurs after heat treatments in air at temperatures above 300\u00b0C. No apparent bulk structure changes have been observed during annealing below this temperature, but heat treatments above this temperature produce darker films containing cupric oxide and its complexes with water.",

      "abstractNote": "A thin film heterojunction photocathode was developed consisting of 100 nm of n-type titanium dioxide (TiO2) cathode surface deposited on p-type cuprous oxide (Cu2O). The cuprous oxide was deposited electrochemically on Ti foil. A photocurrent of 0.7 mA/cm2 (at -1 V bias) and an open circuit photovoltage of 460 mV were obtained under an illumination of 700 W/m2. The photoresponse as a function of pH demonstrated that the TiO2 film protected the Cu2O underlayer against corrosion. These results suggest that using a simple and inexpensive heterostucture configuration, the corrosion limitations of Cu2O alone may be overcome while maintaining a relatively high efficiency for photoelectrolysis.",

      "abstractNote": "In view of the possible application of cuprous oxide in solar energy conversion its physical properties and photoelectrochemical behavior of the phase boundary between the Cu2O and liquid have been investigated. The composition of galvanostatically deposited films is pure Cu2O, but its structure is disordered. The conductivity is due to carriers hopping between localized energy states. At room temperature thin Cu2O films behave like n-type semiconductors. On the basis of the experimental data an energy scheme for the thin oxide semiconductor film is given. From the representative voltammograms in the dark and under illumination it could be concluded that the currents are changed under illumination and that photodegradation takes place. Some unusual phenomena are discussed on the basis of the properties of the thin oxide/electrolyte phase boundary where surface effects are more pronounced than in the bulk material. The conversion efficiency of the Cu2O photoanode in photoelectrochemical cells is below 1%. An analysis of the causes of this poor performance is given.",

Both orthoexcitons and paraexcitons, split by a 12-meV electron-hole exchange energy, are formed. At high excitation levels, the time-resolved luminescence of orthoexcitons yields a density-temperature relation that follows the phase boundary for Bose-Einstein condensation, n=CT3/2, but no striking evidence for a condensed fraction is observed. We have now measured the time-resolved spectrum of the lower-lying paraexcitons whose luminescence is 1500 times weaker than the orthoexciton luminescence. At intermediate power levels, the paraexciton distribution is more degenerate than the orthoexcitons. The relative intensities of the two species indicate that at high excitation levels the paraexciton density exceeds the critical density for condensation. At these high densities the paraexciton spectrum develops a structure that cannot be explained in terms of the thermalized Bose-Einstein distribution. Time-resolved spatial measurements of the luminescence indicate a rapid nondiffusive expansion of the gas at supersonic velocities that approach the expected ballistic velocities of the excitons. The rapid transport and the concurrent changes in the spectral distribution of paraexcitons may be the first observation of excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity.",

Basically, it was found that for 10-ns laser pulses, which are comparable to the exciton lifetime, the exciton-gas temperature rises along the phase boundary for Bose-Einstein condensation as the density is increased. The microscopic processes that lead to such an unusual effect remained unresolved. To isolate the various kinetic processes, we have now conducted a study using 100-ps pulses, which are short compared with the orthoexciton lifetime. Combined with an increased time resolution, this short-pulse excitation has allowed us to observe some of the intrinsic rates of thermalization and decay of the orthoexcitons. At low-to-intermediate excitation levels, the decay of the gas temperature is found to agree with a model of acoustic-phonon emission, and the deduced exciton-phonon coupling is in basic agreement with that obtained from diffusion experiments. Another principal result is that the decay time of the gas temperature is significantly increased with increasing degeneracy, i.e., at high excitation level. After the short excitation pulse the orthoexcitons follow the Bose-Einstein phase boundary in density and temperature in a way similar to their behavior during the \u2018\u2018steady-state\u2019\u2019 conditions of the long-pulse excitation. We conclude that the temperature rise is not simply due to insufficient thermalization caused by a shortening of the exciton lifetime; at high density there must be a heating mechanism such as Auger recombination.",

Emission and absorption of acoustic phonons via the deformation-potential interaction and emission and absorption of nonpolar optical phonons are taken into account in an exact Boltzmann equation that is solved numerically. The model fits the observed distributions well, for a value of the deformation potential in agreement with hydrostatic-pressure and uniaxial-stress measurements. Single-optical-phonon emission is found to be rather slow, with a time scale of about 30 ps. We also present evidence for a fast two-optical-phonon emission process in Cu2O.

The method comprises two stages; in the first one the copper plates are oxidized at 1020 \u00b0C by some hours in line with its initial thickness. In the second stage, the growth of large crystalline areas is promoted by annealing the Cu2O samples at 1100 \u00b0C for long periods. Raman scattering an X-ray measurements demonstrates the existence of the single-phase Cu2O. The effects on the crystalline structure and photoluminescence (PL) response were studied as a function of the conditions used in the second stage of the synthesis method. PL spectra were taken from 10 to 180 K to define the main radiative recombination paths. Besides the near band excitonic transitions, two strong emission bands at 720 and 920 nm associated with relaxed excitons at oxygen and copper vacancies were detected. Both excitonic-vacancy bond transitions presented similar intensities that are related to the growth method. X-ray and Raman scattering measurements help to assess the samples crystalline quality.",

      "abstractNote": "Native defects in cuprous oxide Cu2O are investigated by using first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory. Considering the formation of copper and oxygen vacancies, antisites and interstitials, and a copper split-vacancy complex defect, we analyze the electronic structure and calculate their respective formation energies as a function of the change in Fermi level under both copper-rich and oxygen-rich conditions. We find that, under both growth conditions, the defect with the lowest formation energy is the simple copper vacancy, followed by the copper split-vacancy complex. Both low-energy copper defects produce hole states at the top of the valence band, largely accounting for the p-type conductivity in this material. In spite of the creation of dangling bonds at the nearest-neighbor O atoms, these copper defects are found to be spin neutral. Under oxygen-rich conditions, oxygen interstitials have low formation energies and are found to exhibit a ferromagnetic ordering with a total magnetic moment of 1.38\u03bcB and 1.36\u03bcB at the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, respectively. Considering the possibility of native defect formation at the surface of this material, we investigate the relative stability of both low- and high-index copper-oxide surfaces by comparing their surface free energies as a function of the change in oxygen chemical potential. Using the technique of ab initio atomistic thermodynamics, we then correlate the dependence of the calculated Gibbs free-surface energy as a function of oxygen pressure and temperature via the oxygen chemical potential. We identify two low-energy surface structures, namely, Cu2O(110):CuO and Cu2O(111)-CuCUS, with the former marginally more stable for oxygen-rich conditions and the latter more stable for oxygen-lean (or copper-rich) conditions. Cu2O(110):CuO is calculated to be nonmagnetic and Cu2O(111)-CuCUS is calculated to be a ferromagnetic ordering, with a total magnetic moment of 0.91\u03bcB per defect. With the results for both bulk and surface native defects, we find that under oxygen-lean conditions, a ferromagnetic behavior could be attributed mainly to copper vacancy formation in the (111) surface of Cu2O while under oxygen-rich conditions, low-energy bulk oxygen interstitial defects induce a ferromagnetic character in the same material. This highlights the complementary role of bulk and surface native magnetic defects under different pressure and temperature conditions, especially at the nanoparticle scale where surface properties dominate.",

Photoluminescence at 2 K shows several sharp emission peaks in the vicinity of 610 nm associated with a splitting of various 1s orthoexciton energy levels. The evolution of the peaks with temperature indicates that three peaks at higher energy are due to direct recombination of 1s yellow orthoexcitons and three corresponding peaks at lower energy are their phonon replicas. The symmetry of each level is identified by the polarization properties of their photoluminescence emissions. The observed splitting of the energy levels is used to calculate the coherency strain based on an earlier-parametrized theory for the level splitting by Waters et al. based on the known symmetry of the electronic states. This predicted strain is compared with that determined by x-ray diffraction measurements of the measured lattice parameters.",

The intensity of the luminescence was enhanced while resonantly exciting at the 1s or 2s orthoexciton levels. The direct and phonon-assisted emissions were observed over a wide range of temperatures (1.8-294\ufffdK) under two-photon resonant excitation. The phonon-assisted spectra can be well fit with a Maxwellian distribution with a fitting temperature close to the lattice temperature. The integrated intensity shows a minimum at 20\ufffdK and a maximum around 180\ufffdK. The existence of the direct emission feature enables us to deduce the temperature dependent bandgap and the orthoexciton line width directly up to relatively high temperatures. The red-shift of the orthoexciton energy and the increase of its line width as the temperature increases are interpreted as a temperature dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the exciton self energy.",

Adsorption energies and the energies of the dissociation reaction N2O\ufffd-->\ufffdN2\ufffd+\ufffdO(s) at different sites are calculated. The calculations show that adsorption of N2O is more favorable on CuCUS adsorption site energetically. CuCUS site exhibits a very high activity. The CuCUS-N2O reaction is exothermic with a reaction energy of 77.45\ufffdkJ\ufffdmol-1 and an activation energy of 88.82\ufffdkJ\ufffdmol-1, whereas the OSUF-N2O reaction is endothermic with a reaction energy of 205.21\ufffdkJ\ufffdmol-1 and an activation energy of 256.19\ufffdkJ\ufffdmol-1.

The first type contains the highest levels in the forbidden gap. They create the fast component (tau &ap; 10-4 s) of the photoconductivity at room temperature. Levels lying 0.7 eV below the bottom of the conduction band correspond to the second type of traps. They cause a reversible slow component at temperatures below 130 \ufffdC. The traps associated with the deepest levels (1.35 eV) produce an irreversible slow component of the photoconductivity at temperatures below 120 \ufffdC. The close correlation between the photoconductivity components leads to the assumption that all three types of traps are concentrated on definite sites of the sample. For that reason, with the filling up of traps, barriers are formed in the vicinity of these sites. These barriers determine the kinetics and extent of filling of the traps.",

The growth and the characteristics of the film at rest potential are studied using cathodic stripping analysis in a deaerated solution. Its properties are determined by using the photoelectrochemical technique. It is shown that in BTA solution, the photoactive layer is the same as without BTA, giving the same optical indirect transitions at 2.6 and 1.9 eV, its thickness being in the range of a few nm. Both cathodic and anodic photocurrents are generated and the particular dependence of the spectral response as a function of potential is evidenced and explained. At the rest potential both photocurrents are superimposed. The layer is attributed to cuprous oxide, weakly modified with BTA. In the presence of BTA, changes in the reduction curves are observed and special attention is paid to a cathodic wave in excess, specific to BTA-aerated solutions. The formation of a polymeric copper(I)-BTA outer film is suggested for the formation of a Cu(II)-superoxide complex related to the uptake of molecular dioxygen.",

No subsequent heat treatment is necessary to effect crystallization. The electrode potential spontaneously oscillates during constant-current deposition. At a fixed current density the oscillation period decreases as either the pH or temperature is increased. The oscillations are periodic in stirred solution, but show period doubling and evidence of quasi-periodic or chaotic behavior in unstirred solution. The phase composition and resistivity of the films can be controlled by varying the applied current density. The resistivity of the films can be varied over ten orders of magnitude. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the films are layered.",

In this work, tunnel junctions based on copper metal (Cu) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) are electrochemically self-assembled from aqueous solution in an oscillating system. The Cu2O layer thickness (L) is tuned from 0.8 to 2.8 nm by simply changing the applied current density. The layered structures show sharp negative differential resistance (NDR) signatures at room temperature in perpendicular transport measurements, and the NDR maximum shifts to higher bias with a 1/L2 dependence as the Cu2O layer is made thinner. The results are consistent with resonant tunneling from Cu into hole states in the valence band of quantum-confined Cu2O through thin spacecharge regions on each side of the Cu2O.",

Undoped In2O3\u2013Cu2O heterojunctions prepared by PLD exhibited ohmic current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) characteristics. The ZnO\u2013Cu2O and AZO\u2013Cu2O devices exhibited better rectifying I\u2013V characteristics and photovoltaic properties than the ITO\u2013Cu2O devices. It was found that the obtainable I\u2013V characteristics and photovoltaic properties were considerably affected by the TCO film deposition conditions. An open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.4 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 7.1 mA/cm2, a fill factor (F.F.) of 0.4 and an energy conversion efficiency (\u03b7) of 1.2% were obtained in an AZO\u2013Cu2O device under AM2 solar illumination.

The deposition kinetics of nanocrystalline Cu2O thin films were studied and the parameters limiting the deposition of the films were determined. Pure Cu2O deposited at bath temperature between 0 and 30 \u00c2\u00b0C produced spherically shaped grains with 40\u00a050 nm diameters which have not been reported previously. The effect of pH was studied and a solution with a pH between 5.5 and 6 was found to be best. The effect of annealing on bulk structure, electrical resistivity, and optical absorption of nanocrystalline Cu2O thin films was also studied and the results were discussed.",

They are interpreted on the basis of the model previously worked out for the electrical conductivity. The pre-illumination of a sample increases its bulk conductivity (by a factor up to 104) and shifts downwards the Fermi level (by an energy up to 0.3 eV). This excitation is explained in terms of electron trapping. Direct evidences reveal the existence of four trapping levels. The saturation of the excitation is attributed to the presence, in the acceptor distribution, of strong recombination levels. The study of the wavelength dependence of the photoexcitation allows to confirm the proposed energy diagram and to precise the position of the recombination levels. Finally, the effect of excitation on the Hall mobility is investigated.",

The best conditions found for the formation of frontwall (deposition of Cu by evaporation or sputtering) and backwall (Cu partially oxidized) cells as well as the means to lower the series resistance, are described. Current-voltage characteristics give barrier heights always near 0.7 V and, depending to the mode of preparation, n-values of about 3 or 6 : this implies the existence of interfacial states. The limited cell performances are attributed to inhomogeneities in the junctions and to the low value of the measured diffusion length (1 to 2 \u03bcm).",

Good agreement is also found between the observed luminescence and Elliott's theory of optical absorption, with particular reference to the exciton line asymmetry. The information obtainable from the excitation spectrum of luminescence over and above the data obtained from optical absorption and photoconductivity is discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Interfaces formed by controlled deposition of Al on Cu oxides at 300 K have been characterized using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When Al is deposited onto a thin oxide grown on Cu(110) by atmospheric exposure, it completely scavenges the oxygen from the substrate material, increasing the O(1s) binding energy by 2.0 eV to give the value found for atmospheric oxidation of a thin Al film. Similar oxygen behavior is seen for Al deposition on sputter-deposited CuO with an enriched oxygen surface region, where multilayers of Al erase the shakeup satellites in the Cu(2p) region of the XPS spectrum to give features like those exhibited by Cu2O or metallic Cu. Having calibrated the fluence of the Al source with Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, the attenuation of the Cu 2p1/2 satellite after approximately one monolayer of Al deposition can be associated with oxygen reduction effects in the top 20 \u00c5 of the CuO. Approximately 7\u20138 equivalent monolayers of Al are converted to an oxide in the initial rapid reaction process. Further deposition leads to progressive development of the metallic Al signature in both the XPS and AES spectra. These measurements clearly demonstrate the dominant role played by Al, a strong oxide former, when it is placed in intimate contact with the distinctively weaker Cu oxide.",

The annihilation of these defects has been observed from the photoluminescence and optical absorption measurements after the crystal has been subjected to a second annealing in the temperature range of about 750 \u00b0C under a reducing atmosphere. From the photoluminescence measurements, the density of these defects is found to decrease exponentially as a function of annealing time, as manifested by the reduction in the luminescent intensity. The rate of reduction in intensity is also found to increase with annealing temperature. Because the defects responsible for the luminescence are ascribed to various forms of oxygen vacancies, we believe the decrease in luminescence is due to a reduction in the oxygen vacancies resulting from the formation of copper precipitates in the crystal. The short-wave and medium-wave emissions, which are ascribed to different types of oxygen vacancies, are found to have different activation energies of diffusion.",

The method, which is based on the method used in deep-level transient spectroscopy, involves measuring the luminescent intensity at two different instants of time and looking for the occurrence of peaks when the differential luminescent intensities are plotted as a function of temperature. We applied this method of analysis to the study of the medium-wave (820 nm) luminescence in Cu2O, and found an activation energy E = 0.27 (\u00b10.01) eV. The result obtained by non-linear least-squares analysis was 0.29 (\u00b10.03) eV. The close agreement between the results shows the validity of using this new method of analysis. The potential use of this method is in the characterization of defect levels in semiconductors by comparing peaks in the differential luminescent intensity versus temperature curves.",

Two sputtering modes were investigated in this paper: radiofrequency (RF) and direct current (DC). Using both modes, paramelaconite single phase can be formed in a limited deposition condition range. The growth rate of this phase is high compared to that of the CuO films deposited in the same reactor. The texture of the paramelaconite film is strongly dependant on the sputtering mode and on the deposition conditions. Some of the properties of RF sputtered Cu4O3 films were investigated: optical band gap and electrical resistivity at room temperature. The Cu4O3 films were annealed in air at temperatures ranging from 250 to 350 \u00b0C.",

The thermal behaviours of the two oxides are different. Cuprite has a negative thermal expansion up to about 200 K, and above this temperature it becomes positive. Ag2O, on the other hand, has a negative thermal expansion up to its decomposition temperature. A comparison with EXAFS data in the same temperature range shows that the observed difference between the thermal expansion regimes of the two compounds can be ascribed to the vibrational behaviour of the Cu and Ag atoms and, in the ultimate analysis, to the different rigidities of the metal\u2013oxygen bonds.",

At high temperatures and high oxygen activities, copper metal migrates down the temperature gradient and a gradient in the nonstoichiometry is established under stationary conditions. The heat of transport of copper metal is determined as Q*Cu\u2248180 kJ/mol at a temperature of 1000 \u00b0C and at an oxygen activity of log aO2=\u22122.95. This result agrees with recent theoretical simulations of the heat of transport of atoms migrating via a vacancy mechanism.

Cu2O was prepared in finely polycrystalline form by the complete oxidation of Cu plate in air at temperatures of 1020\u00b0C to 1050\u00b0C. Subsequent annealing of the polycrystalline plates at higher temperatures allowed secondary recrystallization to occur. Single\u2010crystal grains having surface areas larger than 1 in.2 were grown consistently on Cu2O plates having thicknesses of 0.010 in. to 0.060 in. In some cases, entire polycrystalline plates were transformed into single crystals, and as a result, individual single crystals having surface areas of 3 in.2 and larger were obtained. The annealing temperature and the annealing time were found to depend markedly on the plate thickness. Thick plates required lower temperatures and longer annealing times than the thinner plates. X\u2010ray analysis of the large grains verified that they were single crystals without excess strain, and indicated preferred orientation, with the (211) and (311) planes predominating. Resistance profile measurements at room temperature on quenched samples showed that a variation in resistance exists through the thickness of the plate.",

Two equivalent expressions for the line shape are given. The first one, which can be obtained in a heuristic way starting from the second order perturbation theory for the indirect process, but is derived exactly with the use of generalized damping theory, contains, in the energy denominator, the shift and decay matrix which has non-diagonal elements between different exciton bands. Diagonalization of the renormalized energy matrix leads to the second expression--the additivity rule. According to this rule, the whole of the exciton spectra can be decomposed into components, each of which is of asymmetric Lorentzian shape if the width is sufficiently small and the energy dependences of renormalized quantities can be neglected within this width. Not only the results obtained previously, but also various higher order effects are included in the general expressions. Comparison of theory with observations, and a few remarks useful for the analysis of exciton spectra, will be made.",

      "abstractNote": "The diffusion constant and drift mobility of paraexcitons in Cu2O have been determined by the use of time-resolved luminescence imaging. Extremely large diffusion constants (D\u224a1000 cm2/s) and drift mobilities (\u03bc\u224a107 cm2/eV s) are measured at 1.2 K. Both D and \u03bc exhibit very rapid and unusual temperature dependences which vary with applied stress. Calculations described here show that these properties can be attributed to the novel character of paraexcitons in Cu2O. Under zero stress this exciton is expected to couple mainly to longitudinal-acoustic phonons, which have a rather large velocity (\u224a4.5\u00d7105 cm/s). Due to the large excitonic mass (m*\u22433m0), the thermal ve- locity [(3kBT/m*)1/2] of the paraexcitons at T\u22723 K is slower than this sound velocity, causing a freeze-out of the phonon-emission process. A rapid increase in scattering time is expected as the temperature is lowered further, which is in agreement with the data at zero or low stress. As stress is applied, the paraexciton wave function is altered, allowing a coupling to the transverse-acoustic phonons, which have a velocity (\u224a1.2\u00d7105 cm/s) smaller than the exciton thermal velocity. Transverse-phonon emission thus reduces the exciton mobility and produces a more nearly T-3/2 dependence, as predicted for deformation-potential scattering in the high-temperature limit. We believe that these are the first observations of the low-temperature regime of deformation-potential scattering.",

A wavelength-tunable dye laser is used to create excitons directly in the potential well or at any other localized point inside the crystal. Spectral and spatial distributions of the exciton recombination luminescence are measured for cw and pulsed excitation. The possibility of Bose-Einstein condensation of these long-lived excitons is examined both theoretically and experimentally. We calculate the spectral and spatial distribution of luminescence from a gas of noninteracting particles in a three-dimensional harmonic-oscillator well. The results are markedly different for direct (no-phonon) and indirect (phonon-assisted) recombination. The calculated spectra are compared to the data for moderate cw excitation at Tbath=2\u20134.2 K. Taken alone, the no-phonon spectra suggest that the excitonic gas is in the quantum regime; however, this conclusion is shown to be inconsistent with the estimated density of the gas. A consistent interpretation of all spectral and spatial distributions is possible, however, if one assumes Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and takes into account the rapidly changing paraexciton intensity with applied stress. From time- and space-resolved studies of the orthoexciton and paraexciton luminescence, plausible causes for a saturation of paraexciton density in the strain well are deduced.

The results were consistent with neutral oxygen vacancies for oxygen deficit and neutral cation vacancies for oxygen excess in cuprite, neutral oxygen vacancies in Cu1.011Fe1.989O4 + \u03b3 and Cu0.551Fe2.449O4 + \u03b3, neutral cation vacancies in Cu0.984Fe2.016O4 + \u03b3 and neutral associations of interstitial copper atoms in cupric oxide. The defect structures of these compounds were derived from the consideration of equilibrium with respect to oxygen between the solid and the gas phase. The absolute magnitudes of nonstoichiometry, defect concentrations and the enthalpy of defect formation were calculated. The enthalpies of the formation of Schottky defects in \u201cCu2O\u201d and \u201cCuFe2O4\u201d were calculated.",

The cells have V,C up to 0.72 V, compared with 0.35 V for cells made by thermal evaporation of C\" on cu20. Auger studies show that the hydrogen bombardment reduces the top surface of the Cu20 to Cu, creating the Cu/Cu20 junction. The optimum pro- cessing conditions are bombardment at 250 V for 75s at 15 mA. The surface resistivity of the C\" film decreases with bombardment time, but 75s gives adequate continuity in the film. Electron diffraction shows the Cu is formed epitaxially on the Cu20. Encap- sulated cells are relatively stable. The conversion efficiency has reached 1.3% for 1 cm2 cells.",

Based on interfacial I\u2013V characterization and measurement of the temperature dependence of the resistance, we propose that a field-created crystalline defect mechanism, which is controllable for devices, drives the switch.",

      "abstractNote": "The problem of self-compensation of charged dopants is analyzed. Special emphasis is given to dopants in binary oxides. It is shown that one can determine the degree of self-compensation from the properties of the host material and dopant concentration alone. It is further shown that for a native p-type semiconductor, donors are compensated, mostly, by native ionic defects. On the other hand, doping with acceptors allows us to increase significantly the hole concentration, i.e., self-compensation is low under high doping levels. For a native n-type semiconductor the opposite is true, namely, extrinsic acceptors are mainly compensated by native ionic defects. It is shown that the changes in concentration of all the charged defects are simply related by a single factor, the doping factor f, or its power fk where k depends solely on the defect\u2019s charge. Quantitative calculations of f and defect concentrations are presented for Cu2O, which was used as a model material. It is found that for p-type Cu2O doping with donors results in f within the range of 1\u201310, depending on the dopant concentration and P(O2). This means that the hole concentration decreases and the electron concentration increases at most by a factor of 10. Therefore one does not expect to obtain a changeover from p- to n-type cuprous oxide by doping, under equilibrium conditions. Most of the donors are compensated by negative ionic defects. Self-compensation in the presence of amphoteric defects and Fermi level stabilization are discussed, using the former formalism.",

The broadenings and the asymmetries of the absorption lines have been analyzed on the basis of Toyozawa's theory on the general problem of the exciton-phonon interaction: Half-value widths of the yellow- and green-series absorption lines are proportional to temperature above about 80\u00b0K. The asymmetries of the yellow-series absorption lines increase as temperature rises, while those of the green-series lines are nearly constant. The observed contours of the yellow-series absorption lines agree with the asymmetric Lorentzian fairly well. On the contrary, the green-series n=2 line observed at various temperatures deviates slightly from the asymmetric Lorentzian on the high energy side of the peak position. The origin of the line broadening with asymmetry is discussed in terms of the interband exciton scattering by phonons.",

All the properties of the even-parity-exciton series are explained by the presence of a strong Hd term and a strong exchange interaction. We have calculated the even- and odd-exciton members of the yellow and green series within the formalism of Baldereschi and Lipari. An excellent agreement with the experimental results is obtained in the spherical limit. The theory predicts for n=3 a splitting of the S and D states into five components. All the five components are observed by two-photon absorption in a magnetic field of 7 T.",

In the investigated crystal temperature range (127 < T < 570 K), adsorption is always dissociative. Depending on T, impact energy, and angle of incidence, the oxygen atoms end up in different adsorption configurations, characterized by different vibrational signatures. In particular, at grazing incidence when only the step edge is exposed to O2, the adatoms end up initially preferentially at the step edge. An ordered overlayer forms at half monolayer coverage when the adsorbate is mobile. Oxide patches develop eventually for large exposures performed by backfilling and at high crystal temperature.",

Greatly increased penetration of photovoltaics into global energy markets requires an expansion in attention from designs of high-performance to those that can deliver significantly lower cost per kilowatt-hour. To evaluate a new set of technical and economic performance targets, we examine material extraction costs and supply constraints for 23 promising semiconducting materials. Twelve composite materials systems were found to have the capacity to meet or exceed the annual worldwide electricity consumption of 17000 TWh, of which nine have the potential for a significant cost reduction over crystalline silicon. We identify a large material extraction cost (cents/watt) gap between leading thin film materials and a number of unconventional solar cell candidates including FeS2, CuO, and Zn3P2. We find that devices performing below 10% power conversion efficiencies deliver the same lifetime energy output as those above 20% when a 3/4 material reduction is achieved. Here, we develop a roadmap emphasizing low-cost alternatives that could become a dominant new approach for photovoltaics research and deployment.",

      "abstractNote": "One-dimensional (1D) nanoscale materials are currently of great interest due to their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.1-7 Consequently, many 1D nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes,8-10 as well as inorganic nanowires/rods11-17 and nanotubes,18-21 have been synthesized through a variety of methods. Other recent efforts have focused on the synthesis of 1D nanoscale oxide architectures, see for example.22 Our interest lies in application of copper oxide nanostructures to achieve high-performance gas sensors; however, there are few published reports on routes for fabrication of 1D copper oxide nanostructures. In our previous work,23 we synthesized pure Cu2O nanowires using a wet chemical method in which the surfactant poly(ethylene glycol) (Mw 20 000) was used as a soft template. Recently it has been reported that a mixture of CuO and Cu2O nanowires, having a range of diameters from 30 nm to 100 nm, can be fabricated by heating a copper substrate in air.24 In this communication, we report on a novel fabrication route, which requires neither sophisticated techniques nor catalysts and surfactants, to selectively prepare two distinct wirelike copper oxides, either CuO or Cu2O depending on the synthesis conditions, with an average wire diameter of approximately 10 nm. The synthesis strategy for CuO and Cu2O nanowire fabrication starts with a sequence of reactions to first fabricate precursor Cu(OH)2 nanowires. The precursor polycrystalline nanowires are used both as reactants for the growth of CuO and Cu2O nanowires and as templates controlling the size and shape of the resulting nanowires.",

The film consists of straight periodic ditches and ridges, which corresponds to the alternating deposition of nanocrystallites of copper and copper plus cuprous oxide, respectively. The periodicity on the film may vary from 100 nm to a few hundred nanometers depending on the experimental conditions. In the formation of the periodically nanostructured film, oscillating voltage/current has been observed across the electrodes, and the frequency depends on the pH of the electrolyte and the applied current/voltage. A model based on the coupling of [Cu2+] and [H+] in the electrodeposition is proposed to describe the oscillatory phenomena in our system. The calculated results are in agreement with the experimental observations.",

Surface roughness by atomic force microscopy was used to optimize the electrochemical etching processes. Metal/CuO diodes were fabricated by depositing various metals on Al, Ni, and Cu. Current-voltage characterization was performed to investigate the electrical properties of the as-deposited CuO films. CuO grown on electrochemically etched Cu substrates had favorable electrical properties over chemical etched and nonetched substrates as evidenced by better rectification behavior and lower current through the CuO films. Al/CuO diodes showed rectifying behavior, while Ni/CuO and Cu/CuO diodes both showed ohmic behavior. Transmittance measurements of as-deposited CuO showed that CuO has an indirect bandgap of 1.32 eV.

With a 10 L exposure to the surface at 128 K, the interaction was found to be non-dissociative. There is some evidence for the formation of multilayers on the CuO crystal at these low temperatures. As the temperature of the CuO sample increases, the H2O dissociates leaving OH on the surface. A comparison is made with the literature, particularly for the adsorption of water on semiconducting oxides and cuprate superconductors.",

      "abstractNote": "We have examined the decay of thermalized excitons in cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and determined their lifetime against two-body decay (i.e., Auger recombination). The experiments are conducted at T=70\u2002K with near-resonant picosecond excitation to ensure a thermal equilibrium between orthoexcitons, paraexcitons, and the crystal lattice. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals the gas reaching equilibrium with the lattice temperature in 0.5 ns. The wavelength of the excitation photons and the spatial distribution of the laser beam are selected to produce a well defined spatial distribution of excitons. Time-resolved photoluminescence imaging measures the diffusion of excitons. From absolute measurements of the gas volume and the luminescence intensity, we determine the instantaneous gas density. At high excitation levels, a rapid nonexponential decay of the excitonic gas is observed. The decay curve is well explained by assuming that the local exciton density is governed by the rate equation dn/dt=-An2-n/\u03c4, with an Auger constant A=0.6\u00d710-16\u2002cm3/ns and a residual decay time \u03c4=300\u2002ns. This value of the Auger constant is comparable to that estimated previously for a nonthermalized exciton gas at a lattice temperature of 2 K, indicating that the Auger lifetime of an exciton is only weakly dependent on its kinetic energy. The Auger process characterized here defines the practical limits for exciton densities in cuprous oxide.",

The as-prepared Cu2O nanorods were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results indicated that the nanorods were well crystallized and uniform in size. Cu2O nanorods with different aspect ratios were obtained by adjusting the ratio of ethanol and deionized water of the mixed solution. It was proposed that the reducibility of ethanol was influenced by the temperature and the amount of deionized water and it was improved at a higher temperature and less addition of deionized water.",

The peak near 600 m\u03bc can be shifted from shorter to longer wavelengths by exposing the sample to relatively low oxygen pressures at 860\u00b0C. The peak near 800 m\u03bc is found to increase in magnitude relative to the others under these circumstances. This is in apparent contrast to the results of previous investigators. It is further shown that both results are consistent with the values of the high temperature activation energy of the conductivity process, as well as with the change in bandgap as a function of temperature as obtained from optical absorption measurements under the assumption that Cu2O can be classified as a nonpolar semiconductor.",

A number of features of this temperature dependence are discussed with particular reference to making a-c. measurements on a slowly responding photoconductor. It is shown that as the chopping period becomes short in comparison with the response time of the photoconductor, the r.m.s. photoconductivity will decrease linearly with the chopping period for three different types of response considered. Photoresponse at room temperature was also measured on Cu2O after two methods of vacuum annealing, one at 1 000 \u00b0C and the other at 300 \u00b0C. The former shows a sensitivity only for wavelengths less than 0.6 \u03bc, whereas the latter shows the more usual behavior of a peak near 0.6 \u03bc, with sensitivity measurable well into the near infrared.",

The deterioration of the volt\u2010ampere characteristics of cuprous oxide rectifiers after preparation or as a result of extensive heating above 150\u00b0C is explained by the same mechanism.

In contrast to our previous report on oxidized samples which showed the characteristics of double injection diodes, these diodes exhibit the characteristics of single-carrier space-charge-limited (SCL) conduction. The conduction mechanism was confirmed by measurements on the I\u2013V characteristics at various temperatures, the thickness vs. current relation at a given voltage, the effect of photomemory on the I\u2013V characteristics, and the transient current response to applied voltage steps. The results also indicate that there are continuous levels of localized states in these samples in the range 0.06 eV to 0.47 eV above the valence band edge.",

Exposure to a dilute solution of 1-decanethiol resulted in the complete removal and/or conversion of CuO and subsequent formation of a passivating thiolate film, a so-called self-assembled monolayer (SAM), on the underlying Cu/Cu2O surface as evidenced by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Morphological changes, monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealed transformation of the rough, porous CuO layer into a comparatively smooth Cu/Cu2O surface. Experiments performed on integrated circuit back-end-of-line (BEOL) die structures, comprising Cu/SiO2 bond pads used as substrates for Cu wire bonding, demonstrate the potential application of a thiol-based in-situ cleaning-passivation procedure in microelectronics.",

      "abstractNote": "We present X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) investigations of CuO thin films electrochemically deposited on an Au(001) single-crystal surface from a solution containing chiral tartaric acid (TA). The presence of enantiopure TA in the deposition process results in a homochiral CuO surface, as revealed by XPD. On the other hand, XPD patterns of films deposited with racemic tartaric acid or the \u201cachiral\u201d meso-tartaric acid are completely symmetric. A detailed analysis of the experimental data using single scattering cluster calculations reveals that the films grown with l(+)-TA exhibit a CuO(11\u03041\u0304) orientation, whereas growth in the presence of d(\u2212)-TA results in a CuO(1\u030411) surface orientation. A simple bulk-truncated model structure with two terminating oxygen layers reproduces the experimental XPD data. Deposition with alternating enantiomers of tartaric acid leads to CuO films of alternating chirality. Enantiospecifity of the chiral CuO surfaces is demonstrated by further deposition of CuO from a solution containing racemic tartaric acid. The predeposited homochiral films exhibit selectivity toward the same enantiomeric deposition pathway.",

Both methods produced light darker and darker films having different photovoltaic characteristics in a solar cell structure. The photovoltages produced by the light darker films under AM 1.5 illumination was negative as compared to the positive photovoltages produced by the darker films. Spectral response measurements revealed that most of the light darker films produced positive photovoltages in the shorter wavelengths and negative photovoltages in the longer wavelengths. However, some of the light darker films produced only the negative photovoltage for the entire spectral range and their photovoltaic properties were comparatively better. Darker films resulted in only the positive photovoltages in the entire spectral range. As a result of the sulphidation, the bulk crystal structure of the cuprous oxide thin films was not changed, however, the interfacial characteristics of the solar cell structure were modified.",

      "abstractNote": "Cuprous oxide and copper thin films were potentiostatically electrodeposited in an acetate bath. Voltammetric curves were used to investigate the growth parameters; deposition potential, pH and temperature of the bath. Deposition potential dependency on the structural, morphological, optical and electronic properties of the films were investigated by the X-ray diffraction measurements, scanning electron micrographs, absorption measurements and dark and light current-voltage characterisations. It was observed that single phase polycrystalline Cu2O can be deposited from 0 to -\u00c2\u00a0300 mV Vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and co-deposition of Cu and Cu2O starts at -\u00c2\u00a0400 mV Vs SCE. Further increase in deposition potential from -\u00c2\u00a0700 mV Vs SCE produces single phase Cu thin films. Single phase polycrystalline Cu2O thin films with cubic grains of 1-2 [mu]m can be possible within the very narrow potential domain around -\u00c2\u00a0200 mV Vs SCE. Enhanced photoresponse in a photoelectrochemical cell is produced by the Cu2O thin film prepared at -\u00c2\u00a0400 mV Vs SCE, where Cu is co-deposited with Cu2O with random distribution of Cu spheres on the Cu2O surface. This study reveals that a single deposition bath can be used to deposit both Cu and Cu2O separately and an admixture of Cu-Cu2O by controlling the deposition parameters.",

The electronic states of Cu ions and the local structures around these ions are studied using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, respectively. The inner strains in micro-size crystals of the electrodeposited Cu thin film are less than those of a commercial Cu foil. The partial electronic states of Cu ions near the Fermi level (E F) and the local structure around these ions show a systematic transformation from a Cu2O single phase (Phase I), to a Cu2O-Cu intermediate phase (Phase II) and a Cu single phase (Phase III) in thin films electrodeposited on titanium substrates for the deposition potential range of -100 to -900 mV. Phase II consists of independent Cu2O-like and Cu-like local structures, but not a Cu2O-Cu complex. Phase II is also characterized by a transition region from the semiconductor Cu2O to the metal Cu for the Cu electronic state having a p-like character near the Fermi level in the oxygen O-2p conduction band.

Cupric and cuprous films exhibit characteristic photo-current signals, the sign and magnitude of which are a function of band curvature. Semi-conductor properties and aspects of the band structure of the surface films have been determined from observations of the spectral dependence of photo-assisted charge transfer. The positions of voltammetry peaks and the standard potentials of oxide formation are correlated with the flat band potentials of Cu2O and CuO. The inhibition of copper oxidation by illumination and the corrosion of copper in solutions containing O2 are discussed with regard to derived semiconductor models.",

      "abstractNote": "Excitonic matter produced by photoexcitation of a semiconductor crystal at low temperature is able to diffuse or drift macroscopic distances from the point of its creation. This motion can be observed by time-resolved imaging of recombination luminescence or optical absorption. At low densities, the simplest neutral particles -- excitons -- generally exhibit the diffusive motion of classical gases. At high densities, however, the transport behavior can deviate wildly from classical diffusion, as excitonic phase transitions and quantum statistics come into play. In this paper, I will survey a few of the current observations.",

      "abstractNote": "Ortho-para conversion and Auger recombination of excitons in Cu2O are studied by time- and space-resolved luminescence. The interconversion between orthoexcitons and lower-lying paraexcitons is accurately measured at low excitation levels, where ortho and paraexcitons are in thermal equilibrium. Temperature- and stress-dependences of the interconversion rate D(T, [Delta]) imply that down-conversion occurs by TA phonon emission, which provides the needed rotation of the lattice to induce a spin flip. As the excitation level increases, excitons start to undergo a strong density-dependent Auger recombination. We report the measurements of the Auger constant A(T) over the temperature range 72-212\ufffdK. The measured Auger constant is found to depend roughly inversely with the exciton gas temperature over this range and its absolute magnitude is much larger than the present theoretical prediction. The large value of A and a 1/Tgas dependence imply that a thermodynamic BEC of excitons may be impossible to produce in this crystal.",

The normal vacancy configuration, obtained by simple removal of a Cu atom from the lattice, is found to be 0.1 eV higher in energy than a split vacancy configuration wherein a nearby Cu atom is displaced toward a normal vacancy site by half the bulk Cu\u2013Cu separation. Jumps between the normal and split vacancy configurations are predicted to be rate limiting for VCu diffusion with an energy barrier of 0.3 eV. Binding of VCu to substitutional aluminum (AlCu) and indium (InCu) is examined. The neutral (AlCu+2VCu) complex is found to have a binding energy of 3.3 eV whereas the neutral (InCu+2VCu) complex is bound by 1.7 eV. The magnitudes of these binding energies suggest that AlCu and InCu should inhibit VCu diffusion in Cu2O.",

Compared with the dense Cu2O film and the octahedral Cu2O powder, the ordered porous Cu2O film exhibits an improved electrochemical cycling stability. The capacity of the porous Cu2O film can maintain 336\ufffdmAh\ufffdg-1 and 213\ufffdmAh\ufffdg-1 after 50 cycles at the rate of 0.1\ufffdC and 5\ufffdC, respectively. The reversible capacity holds 63.4% as the discharge-charge rate even increases by 50 times. The enhanced high rate properties of the ordered porous film should be attributed to the sufficient contact surface of Cu2O/electrolyte and the short diffusion length of Li+. Moreover, the direct contact between Cu2O and current collector and the decreasing inactive interfaces of Cu2O/polymer binder are also suggested as being responsible for the enhanced high rate property.",

Based on the conventional X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and in situ high-temperature XRD quantitative analysis, in addition to scanning electron microscopy measurement, the phase identification was achieved. Combining the deduction from the component phase diagrams of the binary systems using the phase equilibrium theorem, the primary isothermal phase diagram was plotted over the composition area Cu2O-mullite-SiO2. In this area, the approximate composition areas of two two-phase regions and one three-phase region, (L2 + Cr), (L2 + M), and (L1 + L2 + Tr), were determined. Moreover, the precise composition areas of both of the three-phase regions (L2 + Cr + M) and (L2 + M + A) were determined according to the results of conventional and in situ high-temperature XRD quantitative analysis by Rietveld method.",

The presence of ammonia and the precise control of the molar ratios of the reactants are crucial factors leading to the porous structured Cu2O. The single crystalline framework of the porous Cu2O spheres was produced by the heterogeneous dissolution of the freshly formed single crystalline Cu2O spheres which is similar to the wet chemical etching. As a result, their crystalline character was preserved. Based on the designed experiments and corresponding morphologies of the resultants, the formation mechanism is proposed as coordination-assisted heterogeneous dissolution (CHD). The porous Cu2O possess remarkable photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. This strategy to porous materials via CHD is proved to be convenient and efficient, and provide a potential way to achieve porous structures even for other materials.",

These results demonstrate the importance of surface conditions in oxidation.",

      "abstractNote": "Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles of 35\u00c2\u00a0nm in crystal size have been successfully synthesized via electrochemical method in alkali NaCl solutions with copper as electrodes and K2Cr2O7 as additive. Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MeO) in aqueous Cu2O solution was investigated under either ultraviolet (UV) light or sunlight. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were introduced to characterize the samples. The results indicate that electric current shows no obvious effect on the growth of Cu2O nanocrystals and that 97% of MeO can be decolorized under UV irradiation for 2\u00c2\u00a0h or under sunlight for 3\u00c2\u00a0h when amount of Cu2O is 2\u00c2\u00a0g/L. Recycling use of the catalyst revealed that Cu2O still has a high photocatalytic efficiency when repeatedly used for four times. Cu2O nanoparticles still kept its cubic crystal phase, but fractionally oxidized to be CuO after the photocatalysis. Compared with the original Cu2O nanoparticles, there has 1\u00c2\u00a0eV shift of Cu 2p electron and 1.6\u00c2\u00a0eV shift of Cu Auger signals for the Cu2O powders after four times photocatalysis. Some new peaks can also be observed at 401.1, 237.4 and 170.2\u00c2\u00a0eV in the Cu2O powders after photocatalysis.",

      "abstractNote": "The effect of the bottom electrode material on the resistance switching characteristics was evaluated on the structure of Pt/Cu2O/bottom electrode). It was confirmed that Ohmic or low Schottky contact is needed to induce the effective electric field for resistance switching across the Cu2O film. Pt, TiN, TaN, and strontium-ruthenium oxide belong to this group. For high Schottky contact, the resistance switching characteristics could not be observed due to a large voltage drop at the rectifying interface with insufficient electric field in the Cu2O film. Also, it was confirmed that interlayer formation from the reaction at the electrode-oxide interface increased the barrier height and brought about the switching failure in the case of Ru. The resistance switching properties depend on the barrier height and the reactivity between metal and Cu2O film.",

      "abstractNote": "Single phase cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin films were deposited on TiN substrate with radio frequency sputtering. Cu2O was used as a target material without oxygen to avoid the formation of Cu2O and CuO mixture which was formed in copper oxidation or when using Cu target along with Ar and O2. Single phase cuprous oxide was confirmed with X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Typical growth rate of Cu2O thin film was 14\ufffdnm/min under the optimized process condition. Cu2O thin films were thermally stable up to 250\ufffd\ufffdC, while the phase separation occurred above 350\ufffd\ufffdC. Fundamental properties of Cu2O thin films such as resistivity, mobility, and dielectric constant were obtained. Current-voltage characteristics of Pt/Cu2O/TiN-based structure showed two stable resistance states through the double voltage sweep between -\ufffd2\ufffdV and +\ufffd2\ufffdV. The electrical properties of this structure were described well with space charge-limited conduction mechanism and the full energy-band structure of Cu2O film was obtained.",

      "abstractNote": "In this work, we describe a solution-based synthesis of monodisperse Cu2O nanocrystals with controllable sizes in the nanoscale regime. Two types of nanocrystals, cubes and rhombic dodecahedra unifaceted with either 001 or 110 crystal planes, have been prepared at a 100% morphological yield. In particular, synthetic parameters and formation processes of the Cu2O nanocrystals have been investigated in detail, and a range of well-oriented supercrystals/superlattices built from the two types of nanobuilding blocks have been attained for the first time. It has been revealed that n-hexadecylamine used in the present work plays multiple roles: it serves as a chelating ligand to form [Cu(NH2C16H33)4]2+ complex precursor, as a phase-transferring agent to transfer divalent Cu2+ ions into the organic phase, as a reducing agent to generate monovalent Cu+ (i.e., Cu2O), as a passivating adsorbate to control crystal morphology, and as a surface capping agent to generate self-assemblies of nanocrystals via van der Waals interaction. Apart from synthesis and self-assembly, disassembly and reassembly of Cu2O nanocrystals have also been investigated. The disassembly processes are accompanied with aggregative growths of nanocrystals, which can be attributed to a combined process of \u201coriented attachment\u201d and Ostwald ripening, leading to permanent engagement and enlargement of nanocrystals. Finally, our self-assembled nanocrystals of Cu2O show a lower detection limit, lower operating temperature, and higher sensitivity in ethanol vapor detection, compared with other Cu2O-based alcohol sensors reported in the recent literature. A greater depletion layer of carrier and a relatively small contact potential may account for the observed sensing enhancement in the sensors made from the organized Cu2O nanocrystals.",

Copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) is a metal oxide semiconductor with promising applications in solar energy conversion and catalysis. To understand the Cu/Cu2O/CuO system at the nanoscale, we have developed a method for preparing highly uniform monodisperse nanocrystals of Cu2O. The procedure also serves to demonstrate our development of a generalized method for the synthesis of transition metal oxide nanocrystals. Cu nanocrystals are initially formed and subsequently oxidized to form highly crystalline Cu2O. The volume change during phase transformation can induce crystal twinning. Absorption in the visible region of the spectrum gave evidence for the presence of a thin, epitaxial layer of CuO, which is blue-shifted, and appears to increase in energy as a function of decreasing particle size. XPS confirmed the thin layer of CuO, calculated to have a thickness of 5 A. We note that the copper (I) oxide phase is surprisingly well-stabilized at this length scale.",

The variation in the deposition temperature affected the film morphology and the ratio of copper to oxygen. In case of the films deposited below 200\ufffdC, the main phase was found to be CuO while the amount of the Cu2O phase increased with further increases in deposition temperature. The n-silicon photoelectrode showed enhanced photocurrent-potential (I-V) properties by forming a copper oxide/n-silicon heterojunction. In particular, the electrode, which mainly consisted of a CuO phase, showed better photoelectrochemical conversion efficiencies compared to the Cu2O phase.

      "abstractNote": "Homogeneous cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles with size of 8-10\u00c2\u00a0nm are deposited on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) by a polyol process using Cu(CH3COO)2\u00c2\u00b7H2O as a precursor and diethylene glycol as both solvent and reducing agent. The composition of the resulting Cu2O/MWNTs composites is confirmed by XRD pattern, XPS spectrum and HRTEM images. With the change of the reaction conditions, it is found that Cu2O nanoparticles on the surface of MWNTs can be leafage-like or big spherical particle coated on the surface of MWNTs. HRTEM images indicate that all the leafage-like and big spherical particles are assembled by small Cu2O particles with size of about 2-5\u00c2\u00a0nm. With the assistance of FTIR spectrum, a tentative mechanism is proposed for the formation of Cu2O nanoparticles with different morphologies on the surface of MWNTs.",

The electrical properties of the p-Cu2O/i-ZnO/n-ITO heterojunction were studied using the current-voltage measurements. A distinct junction characteristic was observed. Here, the forward and reverse turn-on voltages were about 0.53 and -0.60\ufffdV, respectively. An energy-band diagram was proposed to analyze the electrical properties. In terms of the results of the current-voltage measurements, it was deduced that the turn-on voltage was smaller than the barrier potential, which was ascribed to the existence of the interface defect states. The mechanism of charge transportation was discussed and a tunnel recombination process was proposed to explain its electrical properties.",

      "abstractNote": "Large-area and aligned copper oxide nanowires have been synthesized by thermal annealing of copper thin films deposited onto silicon substrate. The effects of the film deposition method, annealing temperature, film thickness, annealing gas, and patterning by photolithography are systematically investigated. Long and aligned nanowires can only be formed within a narrow temperature range from 400 to 500 \u00b0C. Electroplated copper film is favourable for the nanowire growth, compared to that deposited by thermal evaporation. Annealing copper thin film in static air produces large-area, uniform, but not well vertically aligned nanowires along the thin film surface. Annealing copper thin film under a N 2 /O 2 gas flow generates vertically aligned, but not very uniform nanowires on large areas. Patterning copper thin film by photolithography helps to synthesize large-area, uniform, and vertically aligned nanowires along the film surface. The copper thin film is converted into bicrystal CuO nanowires, Cu 2 O film, and also perhaps some CuO film after the thermal treatment in static air. Only CuO in the form of bicrystal nanowires and thin film is observed after the copper thin film is annealed under a N 2 /O 2 gas flow.",

The effect of bath temperature, bath pH and current density on the compositon, grain size, surface texture and surface morphology of the electrodeposited films were investigated. The films deposited at low bath pH (\u22647) consisted of copper (I) oxide and metallic copper; while the films deposited at bath pH between 8 and 12 and bath temperature of 60\u00b0C were pure copper (I) oxide. The preferred orientation of the copper (I) oxide films depended on the relative growth rate of 111 and 200 faces and could be controlled by adjusting the bath pH and/or the cathodic current density. (100)-oriented copper (I) oxide films could be deposited at pH=9 and current densities in the range of 0.25\u20131&nbsp;mA/cm2, while (111)-oriented films could be prepared at pH=12 or at pH=9 using the current densities between 1.5\u20132.5 mA/cm2.

      "abstractNote": "In reviewing the results reported for copper oxidation at intermediate temperatures from 573 to 1173 K, the oxidation mechanism at the lower part of this temperature range and the reason for the change in activation energy with decreasing the temperature remain unclear. To make it clear, copper oxidation is studied at 623-1073 K under 0.1 MPa O2 using a commercial 99.9999% pure copper. The oxidation kinetics is essentially parabolic, and the activation energy decreases from 111 kJ/mol at 873-1073 K to 40 kJ/mol at 623-773 K. The growth of Cu2O is predominant and it obeys the parabolic law at 623-773 K, as well as the case at 873-1073 K. In addition to grain boundary diffusion of copper along the fine and thin columnar Cu2O grains, the non-protective CuO whisker layer, which cannot keep the oxygen potential constant at the Cu2O/CuO interface, should be responsible for the decrease in the activation energy at 623-773 K.",

In the Arrhenius plots of the parabolic oxidation rate constants for the double-layer (dl) formation (Cu2O + CuO) at 800-1050\u00b0C in 0.1 MPa O2 atmosphere, the points for FZR copper essentially followed a straight line. For 6 N and 4 N coppers, the oxidation kinetics at high temperatures (above 950\u00b0C) was almost the same as that for FZR copper, but the points at lower temperatures followed two lines with smaller slopes. This result suggests that the oxidation of FZR copper was governed by the lattice diffusion at 800-1050\u00b0C. Trace impurities had almost no influence on the oxidation kinetics of 6 N and 4 N coppers at temperatures above 950\u00b0C where the lattice diffusion predominated. However, at lower temperatures where the grain boundary diffusion also contributes to oxidation, trace impurities decreased the activation energy by impeding the growth of Cu2O grains to facilitate the grain boundary diffusion. The activation energy governed by the lattice diffusion was 173 kJ/mol for the dl formation, while it was 98 kJ/mol for the single-layer formation (Cu2O). This supports a (pO2)1/4 dependence of the parabolic rate constant associated with the diffusion of copper atoms via neutral copper vacancies in the Cu2O layer.",

The Cu2O specimens were prepared through completely oxidizing 99.99999 and 99.5 pure copper at 1000\u00b0C in an Ar + 1 O2 atmosphere. The oxidation kinetics of Cu2O specimens prepared from both purity levels followed the logarithmic law, not the parabolic law or the cubic law as reported in the literature. The activation energy for Cu2O oxidation is relatively high in the lower-temperature range, but becomes very small or even negative at higher temperatures. The logarithmic oxidation rate law can be explained by Davies et al.\u2019s model related to grain-boundary diffusion in the oxide layers. The very small or negative activation energies in the higher-temperature range can be attributed to the very small thermodynamic driving force and the fast lateral growth of CuO grains related to a sintering effect. The influence of small amount of impurities is also discussed.",

Oxidation of 6 N copper after 60 s showed that the number density of the oxide nuclei varied with the face of copper crystals, while the nucleation occurred preferentially at the grain boundaries. A metallographic examination indicated that the products of initial oxidation consist of both CuO and Cu2O. CuO is firstly formed as a thin uniform film on the copper surface, and then Cu2O nucleates and grows beneath the CuO film. This result is different from the conclusion reached in the literature that CuO does not appear until the laterally growing Cu2O nuclei have covered the whole surface using other methods. In contrast to 6 N copper, nucleation of Cu2O was much delayed for 2 N copper, though a thin CuO film was similarly formed on 2 N copper surface. Impurities in 2 N copper should be responsible for slow nucleation of Cu2O and slow growth of nuclei.",

It is based on the energy level diagram which has been proposed in a previous paper, for the interpretation of the phenomenology of the photomemory effect. A simple, although general, mathematical treatment of the problem, is given. A good agreement is found between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. The excitation process closely satisfies the reciprocity law. The depths and the capture cross sections of traps A and B are determined by two independent methods. The first one is based on a fit between the theoretical and experimental thermal variations of the density of trapped electrons at constant heating rate; the second one uses the correlation between the temperature of the conductivity maximum and the heating rate. The nature of the trapping centres is discussed.",

The inconsistency in assignments for the zone center modes and the lack of not only assignments but identifications of the zone boundary phonon required the use of second order Raman and IR spectra as the useful probes. The basis for the interpretation of these spectral data is given in terms of reduction coefficients for ordinary products and symmetrized squares and cubes of representations in the \"cuprite\" structure Oh4-Pn3m. They are presented for the R, X, M and [Gamma] points of the Brillouin zone. They will serve for obtaining selection rules, invariants, and covariants for this structure. Additional tables are given that enable one to identify what pair of phonons correspond to electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, or Raman transitions, respectively.",

Plots of the thermoelectric power Q vs 1/T at different constant oxygen pressures yield parallel straight lines with a slope of 0.75 V. Plots of Q vs logP are mostly straight lines with slopes approximating (\u20142.3k) / (8q), in which k is Boltzmann's constant and q is the electronic charge. These results can be explained fairly satisfactorily in terms of a modified Wagner model for the defect structure of Cu2O and existing theories of the thermoelectric effect in semiconductors. It is assumed that the concentration of acceptors is a function of both the oxygen pressure and the temperature and that a gradient of acceptors exists along the temperature gradient. Thus, the model shows that the factor 8, originally obtained from conductivity measurements, should also be contained in the slope of Q vs logP. The slope of 0.75 V for the plot of Q vs 1/T can be related to the energy of creating an acceptor, i.e., a copper atom vacancy, plus the energy of ionizing this acceptor.",

      "abstractNote": "A number of crucible materials were evaluated for melting Cu2O. Only MgO appears to be sufficiently nonreactive for use in crystal growing. A melt of cuprous oxide contained in a magnesia crucible when cooled at a rate of 2.5\u00b0C per hour produced large single crystals. Attempts to accelerate growth by cooling at a rate of 13.5\u00b0C per hour produced only small polycrystals. A (100) seed cut from the single crystal along natural cleavage lines was used to pull a crystal from the melt by the Czochralski method. A tendency to grow off-axis resulted in beautiful subsurface facets of transparent ruby-red material. Two new forms of luminescence were observed during rapid cooling of solid cuprous oxide. From 1175\u00b0 to 1145\u00b0C continuous light emission was observed in the yellow-green region. From 1125\u00b0 to 975\u00b0C flashing points of light were observed in the same spectral region.",

      "abstractNote": "A striking feature of metal oxide chemistry is the unusual electronic and chemical behaviour of Cu(I) and Ag(I): a case in point is that detailed understanding of Cu\u2013O bonding is essential to the theory of high-temperature copper oxide superconductors. Both cations are usually coordinated in a linear fashion to two oxygens, particularly for Cu(I). In many compounds, the Cu(I) and Ag(I) cations also adopt close-packed (and related) configurations with short metal\u2013metal distances that are strongly suggestive of the occurrence of metal\u2013metal bonding1, 2 despite their formal nd 10 configuration. Such observations have been explained3, 4 by invoking the participation in bonding of electronic orbitals of higher principal quantum number\u2014that is, (n + 1)s and (n + 1)p\u2014accompanied by the creation of d-orbital holes on the metal ion. To test this hypothesis, we have used a recently developed method of quantitative convergent-beam electron diffraction5 combined with X-ray diffraction to map the charge-density distribution in the simple oxide Cu2O, the results of which we then compare with electronic-structure calculations. We are able to image directly the d holes on the copper atoms, and also demonstrate the existence of Cu\u2013Cu bonding in this compound.",
