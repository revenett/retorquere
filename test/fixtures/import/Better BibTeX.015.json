        "<p>Extracted Annotations (zondag 17 november 2013 15:45:35) &quot;What is the relationship between globalization and the nation-state? Is the nation-state being undermined?&quot; (Robinson 2007:127) Relatedly, to what extent is the relationship between social structure and territoriality being redefined by globalization? Is there a deterritorialization of social relations under globalization? What is the relationship between the local and the global? How are space and time being reconfigured? (note on p.127) &quot;Relatedly, to what extent is the relationship between social structure and territoriality being redefined by globalization? Is there a deterritorialization of social&quot; (Robinson 2007:127) &quot;relations under globalization? What is the relationship between the local and the global? How are space and time being reconfigured?&quot; (Robinson 2007:128) &quot;THE NETWORK SOCIETY Manuel Castells&apos; groundbreaking trilogy, The Rise of the Network Society (1996, 1997, 1998), exemplifies a &apos;technologistic&apos; approach to globalization&quot; (Robinson 2007:132) &quot;&apos;communication decisively shapes culture because we do not see . . . reality as it &apos;is&apos; but as our languages are&apos;. He adds, &apos;we are not living in a global village, but in customized cottages, globally produced and locally distributed&apos; (1996: 370).&quot; (Robinson 2007:133)</p>"
