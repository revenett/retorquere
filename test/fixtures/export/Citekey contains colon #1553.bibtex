  abstract = {Blockchains is a special type of distributed systems that operates in unsafe networks. In most blockchains, all nodes should reach consensus on all state transitions with Byzantine fault tolerant algorithms, which creates bottlenecks in performance. In this paper, we propose a new type of blockchains, namely Value-Centric Blockchains (VCBs), in which the states are specified as values (or more comprehensively, coins) with owners and the state transition records are then specified as proofs of the ownerships of individual values. We then formalize the ``rational'' assumptions that have been used in most blockchains. We further propose a VCB, VAPOR, that guarantees secure value transfers if all nodes are rational and keep the proofs of the values they owned, which is merely parts of the whole state transition record. As a result, we show that VAPOR enjoys significant benefits in throughput, decentralization, and flexibility without compromising security.},
  annote = {Here defined transaction-centric-blockchains TCB and account-centric-blockchain ACB. They propose a new model of value-centric-blockchain VCB.
\par
Overall the VCB concept --- I don't get it. The paper is not an easy read, it lacks clear examples and help in understanding the differences between VAPOR and others.

Browsed, decided not to try to understand VAPOR in detail.},
