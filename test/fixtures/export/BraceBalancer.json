      "abstractNote": "Beauty is an important part of our lives. Ugliness too. It is nosurprise then that philosophers since antiquity have been interestedin our experiences of and judgments about beauty and ugliness. Theyhave tried to understand the nature of these experiences andjudgments, and they have also wanted to know whether these experiencesand judgments were legitimate. Both these projects took a sharpenedform in the 20th century, when this part of our lives came under asustained attack in both European and American intellectual circles.Much of the discourse about beauty since the 18th century had deployeda notion of the “aesthetic”, and so that notion inparticular came in for criticism. This disdain for the aesthetic mayhave roots in a broader cultural Puritanism, which fears theconnection between the aesthetic and pleasure. Even to suggest, in therecent climate, that an artwork might be good because it ispleasurable, as opposed to cognitively, morally or politicallybeneficial, is to court derision. The 20th century has not been kindto the notions of beauty or the aesthetic. Nevertheless, some thinkers— philosophers, as well as others in the study of particulararts — have persisted in thinking seriously about beauty and theaesthetic. In the first part of this essay, we look at theparticularly rich account of judgments of beauty given to us byImmanuel Kant. The notion of a “judgment of taste” iscentral to Kant's account and also to virtually everyone working intraditional aesthetics; so we begin by examining Kant'scharacterization of the judgment of taste. In the second part, we lookat the issues that 20th century thinkers have raised. We end bydrawing on Kant's account of the judgment of taste to consider whetherthe notion of the aesthetic is viable.",
