## Work has started (again) on the Zotero 5 rewrite.

Work is being tracked in a github issue [here](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/555) and a
Trello board for more fine-grained stuff [here](https://trello.com/b/OpJQyVTP/better-bibtex-for-zotero-5).

The Zotero 4 branch is still available [here](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/tree/zotero-4)
