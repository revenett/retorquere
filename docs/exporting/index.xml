      <description>Better BibTex adds a couple of export formats to Zotero&amp;rsquo;s export dialog. The Better BibTeX configuration pane can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab &amp;lsquo;Better BibTeX&amp;rsquo;. Through the configuration pane of BBT you can customize the BibTeX file that will be exported:
 Automated background exports. Tick &amp;lsquo;keep updated&amp;rsquo; during export, and that&amp;rsquo;s that. Unicode conversion: the default is to retain unicode characters on export for BibLaTeX, and to convert to LaTeX commands (where possible) for BibTeX.</description>

      <description>You wanted customized&amp;hellip; You got customized. If you go into the Advanced tab of the Better BibTeX preferences you will find a text box (empty by default) where you can edit a javascript snippet which will be executed for each reference generated in the Bib(La)TeX exporter. In this code, you have access to the reference just before it will be written out and cached. There is an API to do this, and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly stable, but usually you can just open a new issue and ask me to write it, and I&amp;rsquo;ll add it here (it&amp;rsquo;s how the examples got here).</description>

      <description>You are a hardcore LaTeX user If you&amp;rsquo;d really just rather hand-code your LaTeX constructs, BBT makes that possible:
 You can add literal LaTeX anywhere in your reference by surrounding it with &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;....&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; tags. BBT will convert to/from unicode and (un)escape where required but will pass whatever is enclosed in the pre tags unchanged. An entry tagged with #LaTeX (case-sensitive!) will have all fields exported as if they&amp;rsquo;re wrapped in &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;.</description>
