<p>Before all else, <strong><em>thank you for taking the time for submitting an issue</em></strong>, and I’m sorry that I’ve probably
interrupted your flow.</p>

<p>Your report matters to me. I love hearing my software helps you, and it pains me to know that things aren’t working for
you.  If you have any questions on the use of the plugin, please do not hesitate to file a GitHub issue to ask for help.
If you’re reporting a bug in the plugin, please take a moment to glance through the Support Request Guidelines; it will
make sure I get your problem fixed as quick as possible. Clear bug reports commonly have time-to-fix of 10 minutes. The
guidelines are very detailed, perhaps to the point of being off-putting, but please do not fret; these guidelines simply
express my ideal bug submission. I of course prefer very clearly documented issue reports over fuzzy ones, but I prefer
fuzzy ones over missed ones.</p>

<h1 id="known-problems">Known problems</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Better BibTeX will fail with incomprehensible errors if you run but Zotero Standalone and Zotero for Firefox
simultaniously <a href="https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/143">#143</a></li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>If Zotero stalls with BBT installed, it is often a one-time thing as the [[cache fills</td>
          <td>Performance]]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submitting-an-issue">Submitting an issue</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, however, my time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I
cannot accept bug reports or support requests on anything but the latest version.</p>

<p>If you submit an issue report, please include the version that you are on. By the time I get to your issue, the latest
version might have bumped up already, and you will have to upgrade (you might have auto-upgraded already however) and
re-verify that your issue still exists. Apologies for the inconvenience, but such are the breaks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can send off an error report by choosing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Report Better BibTeX Errors</code> from the gear menu. Post the resulting ID
(displayed in red) in a github issue.</li>
  <li>You can send off an error report for a specific collection or (selection of) items that fails to export by selecting those, right-clicking
and choosing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Report Better BibTeX Errors</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That in itself will in many cases give me what I need. Don’t forget to copy the generated ID to paste it into the github
issue; you cannot call it up later (although you can just do it again).</p>

<p>For the fastest fix:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please include <em>specifics</em> of what doesn’t work</strong>. I use this plugin every day myself, so “it doesn’t work” is trivially
false. Please tell me what you expected and what you see happening, and the relevant difference between them.</li>
  <li><strong>Please don’t file a jumble of problems in one issue</strong>. Posting a slew of separate issues is much preferred, as I can
more easily tackle them one by one.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not hijack existing issues</strong>. You can chime in on existing issues if you’re close to certain it is the same problem,
otherwise, open a new issue. I rather have duplicate issues than issues I cannot close because they are in fact two or
more issues.</li>
  <li><strong>If your problem pertains to <em>importing BibTeX files</em>,</strong> you <strong><em>must</em></strong> put up a sample for me to reproduce the issue with.
<em>Do not</em> paste the sample in the issue, as the issue tracker will format it into oblivion. Instead, choose one of
these options:
    <ul>
      <li>Post an URL in the issue where I can download your sample, or</li>
      <li>Put the sample in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> and post the URL of the gist into the issue, or</li>
      <li>upload your files to <a href="http://dbinbox.com/allthatisthecase">dbinbox</a> – please use descriptive file names (at least
the issue number), as I can’t see who uploaded what.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If your problem pertains to BBT interfering with other plugins</strong> (which wouldn’t be the first time), and this interference
has something to do with importing, you <strong><em>must</em></strong> include a sample file that triggers the issue. I know it may seem
that “any file triggers it” – I need a <em>specific</em> file that does so I know we’re looking at the same problem.</li>
</ul>
