# Better Bib(La)TeX for Zotero/Juris-M [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex)

This extension aims to make Zotero/Juris-M effective for us text-based authoring holdouts;
currently, that translates to the LaTeX/Markdown crowd. To get started, read the
[[Installation]] instructions. At its core,
it behaves like any Zotero import/export module; anywhere you can export or import bibliography items in Zotero,
you'll find *Better Bib(La)TeX* listed as one of the choices.  If nothing else, you could keep your existing workflow as-is,
and just enjoy the improved LaTeX &harr; unicode translation on import and export. 
Over and above this improvement, it adds the following features to Zotero:

* Stable [[Citation Keys]], without key clashes! Generates citation keys that take into account other existing keys in your library
  that are not part of the items you export. Prevent random breakage!
* Converts from/to HTML/LaTeX: Currently supports `<i>...</i>`/`\emph{...}`/`\textit{...}`, `<b>...</b>`/`\textbf{...}`, `<sup>...</sup>`/`\_{...}` and `<sub>...</sub>`/`^{...}`. More can
  be added [on request](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/new). Finally add *italics* and super/supscript to your titles! The plugin contains a comprehensive list
  of LaTeX constructs, so stuff like `\"{o}` or `\"o` will be converted to their unicode equivalents on import (e.g., `\"{o}` to `รถ`). If you need
  literal LaTeX in your export: surround it with `<pre>`...`</pre>` tags.
* Set your own, fixed [[Citation Keys]], generate citation keys from [JabRef patterns](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/help/LabelPatterns.php), drag and drop LaTeX citations, add other custom BibLaTeX fields.
* Highly [[Customized Exports]].
* Fixes date field exports: export dates like 'forthcoming' as 'forthcoming' instead of empty.
* [[Push/Pull Export|Push-and-Pull-Export]] from the embedded webserver.
* Automatic [[journal abbreviation|Citation-Keys]].


Better Bib(La)TeX works from [BibTeXing](http://ctan.cs.uu.nl/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf) and [Tame the
BeaST](http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~markey/BibTeX/doc/ttb_en.pdf) for BibTeX, and
[The Biblatex Package](http://ctan.mirrorcatalogs.com/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf) for BibLaTeX, but
since there isn't really a definitive manual for either format that is universally followed by Bib(La)TeX
editors/processors, I'm pragmatic about implementing what works.

# Got problems? We got fixes!

If you have any questions on the use of the plugin, please do not hesitate to [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/new)
to ask for help. If you're reporting a bug in the plugin, please take a moment to glance through the 
[[Support Request Guidelines|Support]];
it will make sure I get your problem fixed as quick as possible. Clear bug reports commonly have time-to-fix of 10 minutes.
The guidelines are very detailed, perhaps to the point of being off-putting, but please do not fret;
these guidelines simply express my ideal bug submission.
I of course prefer very clearly documented issue reports over fuzzy ones,
but I prefer fuzzy ones over missed ones.
