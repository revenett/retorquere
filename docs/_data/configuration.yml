        Used for drag-and-drop/quick copy using Better BibTeX citekeys. In the

        Used for drag-and-drop/quick copy citations in `LaTeX` format. Set the
        desired LaTeX citation command here. If you set this to `citep`,
        drag-and-drop citations will yield `\citep{key1,key2,...}`
    Surround Pandoc citations with brackets:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        Used for drag-and-drop/quick copy citations in `Pandoc` format. You can
        use this option to select whether you want to have these pandoc
        citations surrounded with brackets or not.
    Citation key format:
      default: '"â€‹[auth:lower][shorttitle3_3][year]"'
      description: >-
        Set the pattern used to generate citation keys. The format of the keys
        is documented [here](citation-keys).
    Force citation key to plain text:
      default: 'true'
      description: >-
        If you have deviated from the default citation key format pattern by
        [specifying your own](citation-keys), you may wind up with non-ASCII
        characters in your citation keys. You can prevent that using the `fold`
        function at the appropriate place in your pattern, but checking this
        checkbox will just apply `fold` to all your keys.
    'On conflict, non-pinned keys will be':
      default: kept (causes key duplicates)
      description: >-
        This determines what happens if you pin a key to a value that is already
        in use in a different reference but not pinned there. Neither are ideal,
        you just get to pick your poison. If you let BBT change the non-pinned
        key by adding a postfix character, the citation key changes which could
        be problematic for existing papers.  if you keep the non-pinned key
        as-is, your library now has duplicate keys.
      options:
        - postfixed (causes key changes)
        - kept (causes key duplicates)

  preferences:
    'When a reference has both a DOI and a URL, export':
      default: both
      description: >-
        Does what it says on the tin, really. If a reference has both a DOI and
        an URL, you can choose to have them both exported, or either one of
        them.
      options:
        - both
        - DOI
        - URL
    Export unicode as plain-text latex commands:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        BibLaTeX actually has really good Unicode support, so you generally want
        this off. But for some geezers such as me it is simply more pleasing to
        have things like accented characters translated to their equivalent
        LaTeX constructs on export.
    Export unicode as plain-text latex commands (recommended):
      default: 'true'
      description: >-
        BibTeX has really spotty Unicode support, so you generally want this on.
        It will translate things like accented characters to their equivalent
        LaTeX constructs on export.
    'Assume single-word strings to be externally-defined @string vars, and thus not surrounded by braces':
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        When enabled, single-word strings will be assumed to be
        externally-defined @string vars, and thus not surrounded by braces. If
        you don't know what this means, leave it off.
    Disregard name prefixes when sorting:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        Name handling is a lot more complex than I had ever thought it to be. A
        *lot* more complex. BibTeX has really limited ways of dealing with names
        with particles (van, von, de, etc). If you turn this on, BBT will add
        code to have `van Gogh` sorted under `Gogh`.
    Fields to omit from export (comma-separated):
      default: '""'
      description: >-
        If there are some fields you don't want in your bibtex files (such as
        `note` for example), add a list of them here, separated by comma's.
    Add URLs to BibTeX export:
      default: 'no'
      description: >-
        BibLaTeX supports urls in your references natively; BibTeX does not. For
        this reason, URLs are omitted from BibTeX exports by default. Using this
        setting you can have them added to your exports either in a `note` field
        (not as clean, but compatible with BibTeX out of the box), or in a `url`
        field (requires extra packages to be loaded, or bibtex will error out).
      options:
        - 'no'
        - in a note field
        - in a URL field
    'Abbreviation style:':
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        If set, generates journal abbreviations on export using the Zotero
        journal abbreviator, according to the abbreviation style selected in the
        list below the checkbox.
    'Include JabRef-specific metadata:':
      default: 'no'
      description: >-
        Export JabRef-specific information fields; timetamps and groups for
        collections.
      options:
        - 'no'
        - for JabRef 3
        - for JabRef 4
    Include comments about potential problems with the references:
      default: 'false'
      description: Generate quality reports for exported references.
    Use BibLaTeX extended name format (requires biblatex 3.5):
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        Use the extended biber 2.7 format for names with particles - only works
        in BibLaTeX 3.5 or later. This biblatex has a new (less ambiguous) way
        to store creator names. It's technically superior, but the LaTeX world
        moves slowly, so many people won't have it yet. But if you're an early
        adopter, you can enable it here
- name: Automatic export

  preferences:
    Automatic export:
      default: On Change
      description: >-
        Determines when [automatic exports](push-and-pull) are kicked off.
        Having it disabled still marks auto-exports as needing updates, so when
        you re-enable it, those exports will start. On-change means exports
        happen whenever a reference in the export changes/is added/is removed.
        On idle does more or less what `Disabled` (that is, no exports but mark
        as needing changes), but will kick off exports when your computer is
        idle. You mostly want this if your computer is performance-constrained
        (aka slow).

        For those who are curious about what the "Clear/Generate BibTeX key"
        right-click options do, this will warn you if you are doing this on more

  preferences:
    autoAbbrevStyle:

      description: >-
        Select the style for auto-abbreviation. Only applicable to Juris-M; in
        Zotero, the style for automatic abbreviation is not configurable.
    autoExportIdleWait:
      default: '10'
      description: >-
        Number of seconds to wait after your system goes idle before kicking off
        auto-exports.
    cacheFlushInterval:
      default: '5'
      description: >-
        How often the Better BibTeX database should be saved to disk. Defaults
        to once every 5 seconds. Note that your database is always saved when
        your computer goes idle, or when you exit Zotero.
    csquotes:
      default: '""'
      description: >-
        if you set `csquotes` to a string of character pairs, each pair will be
        assumed to be the open and close parts of a pair and will be replaced
        with a `\\enquote{...}` construct.

        BBT will pick.
    biblatexExtendedDateFormat:
      default: 'true'
      description: Support for EDTF dates in biblatex
    suppressTitleCase:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        If you're dead-set on ignoring both BibTeX/BibLaTeX best practice and
        the Zotero recommendations on title/sentence casing, set this preference
        to "true" to suppress [title casing for English
        references](Unnecessarily-complicated-BibTeX-output%3F#mapping-fields).
    itemObserverDelay:
      default: '100'
      description: >-
        I've had reports where Zotero notifies extensions that references have
        changed, but if BBT then actually retrieves those same references,
        Zotero complains they "haven't been saved yet". Super. This preference
        sets the number of microseconds BBT should wait after being notified
        before acting on the changed references.
    parseParticles:
      default: 'true'
      description: Name particle handling
    citeprocNoteCitekey:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        Replaces the "note" field with the bibtex key during citation rendering
        in Word/Libreoffice. Main use-case is to help migrating word documents
        to pandoc. This setting only takes effect during startup, so if you
        change it, you will have to restart Zotero to have this take effect (or
        to disable it. Please disable it when done). You will want to use a
        custom CSL style (such as
        [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/master/better-bibtex-citekeys.csl))
        to make this work.
    scrubDatabase:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        Finds potential problems in the database and fixes those. This runs
        **extremely** slow at startup, don't unable this unless explicitly asked
        to.
    lockedInit:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        BBT locks the UI during startup because I have been told in no uncertain
        terms I am not to touch the Zotero database before I get an all-clear
        from Zotero. This all-clear takes a fair amount of time. As BBT needs
        database access for generating keys, and *everything* in BBT depends on
        the keys being present, it is absolutely safest to make sure BBT
        initialization has completed before freeing the UI. I want to stress
        that during most of the lock-time, BBT is simply waiting for Zotero to
        complete its own initialization; try to do an export of any kind (not
        just BBT) or to import new references directly after Zotero has started
        and you'll notice that it may take a while before Zotero reacts. The
        lockout just puts a face on this hidden init, and prevents nasty race
        conditions between the BBT and Zotero initialization leading to
        unpredictable breakage occasionally.


        If you however cannot stand the lockout during startup and you want to
        live dangerously, you can turn this off and hope that no race conditions
        bite you. If you turn this on and experience problems, you are welcome
        to file a bug report and I will see what I can do, but be prepared for
        the answer to be "turn this back on for now".


        This is **EXPERIMENTAL** and this preference may disappear at any moment
        without notice.
    autoPin:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        When on, BBT will automatically pin the first citekey it generates for
        an item.
    kuroshiro:
      default: 'false'
      description: >-
        When on, BBT will load kuroshiro for romajization in citekeys. This uses
        a lot of memory, easily 100MB. If you don't have Japanese titles/names,
        keep this off.
