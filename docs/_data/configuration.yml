    autoExportDelay:

      description: If you have auto-exports set up, BBT will wait this many seconds
        before actually kicking off the exports to buffer multiple changes in quick
        succession setting off an unreasonable number of auto-exports. Minimum is
        1 second. Changes to this preference take effect after restarting Zotero.

    autoExportPrimeExportCacheBatch:
      default: '10'
      description: If cache priming is kicked off (see `autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold`),
        the cache will be primed in batches of `autoExportPrimeExportCacheBatch`.
        The lower this number is, the longer the priming will take (there's a fixed
        per-prime overhead), but (since the priming uses exports under the hood) the
        larger it is, the longer the priming actions will lock the UI. The batch size
        is capped to the value of `autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold`.
    autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold:
      default: '0'
      description: If an auto-export is triggered and there are more than `autoExportPrimeExportCacheThreshold`
        un-cached entries, prime the cache before starting the auto-export. This makes
        the export take longer in total, but since exports in Zotero lock up the UI,
        priming helps making the actual export run as fast as possible. Really only
        useful for large exports, but what counts as large is system-dependent, so
        you can play with this value. The default of `0` disables priming. This is
        a temporary measure until https://groups.google.com/d/msg/zotero-dev/lHYEtdgPHCE/nDUyxpFmAgAJ

    lockedInit:

      description: 'BBT locks the UI during startup because I have been told in

        no uncertain terms I am not to touch the Zotero database

        before I get an all-clear from Zotero. This all-clear takes a fair amount
        of time. As BBT needs database

        access for generating keys, and *everything* in BBT depends on the keys being
        present, it is absolutely safest

        to make sure BBT initialization has completed before freeing the UI. I want
        to stress that during most of the

        lock-time, BBT is simply waiting for Zotero to complete its own initialization;
        try to do an export of any

        kind (not just BBT) or to import new references directly after Zotero has
        started and you''ll notice that it

        may take a while before Zotero reacts. The lockout just puts a face on this
        hidden init, and prevents nasty

        race conditions between the BBT and Zotero initialization leading to unpredictable
        breakage occasionally.


        If you however cannot stand the lockout during startup and you

        want to live dangerously, you can turn this off and hope that

        no race conditions bite you. If you turn this on and experience

        problems, you are welcome to file a bug report and I will see what I can do,
        but be prepared

        for the answer to be "turn this back on for now".
