'`abbr`': >-
  Abbreviates the text. Only the first character and subsequent characters
  following white space will be included.
'`alphanum`': >-
  clears out everything but unicode alphanumeric characters (unicode character
  classes `L` and `N`)
'`ascii`': removes all non-ascii characters
'`capitalize`': uppercases the first letter of each word
'`clean`': transliterates the citation keys and removes unsafe characters
'`condense`': >-
  this replaces spaces in the value passed in. You can specify what to replace
  it with by adding it as a

  parameter, e.g `condense=_` will replace spaces with underscores. **Parameters
  should not contain spaces** unless

  you want the spaces in the value passed in to be replaced with those spaces in
  the parameter
'`fold`': >-
  tries to replace diacritics with ascii look-alikes. Removes non-ascii
  characters it cannot match
'`lower`': >-
  Forces the text inserted by the field marker to be in lowercase. For example,
  `[auth:lower]` expands the last name of the first author in lowercase.
'`nopunct`': Removes punctuation
'`nopunctordash`': Removes punctuation and word-connecting dashes
'`postfix`': >-
  postfixes with its parameter, so `postfix=_` will add an underscore to the end
  if, and only if, the value

  it is supposed to postfix isn't empty
'`prefix`': >-
  prefixes with its parameter, so `prefix=_` will add an underscore to the front
  if, and only if, the value

  it is supposed to prefix isn't empty. If you want to use a reserved character
  (such as `:` or `\`), you'll need to

  add a backslash (`\`) in front of it.
'`select`': >-
  selects words from the value passed in. The format is `select=start,number`
  (1-based), so `select=1,4`

  would select the first four words. If `number` is not given, all words from
  `start` to the end of the list are

  selected. It is important to note that `select' works only on values that have
  the words separated by whitespace,

  so the caveat below applies.
'`skipwords`': >-
  filters out common words like 'of', 'the', ... the list of words can be seen
  and changed by going into

  `about:config` under the key
  `extensions.zotero.translators.better-bibtex.skipWords` as a comma-separated,

  case-insensitive list of words.
'`substring`': '(`substring,start,n`) selects `n` characters starting at `start`'
'`upper`': >-
  Forces the text inserted by the field marker to be in uppercase. For example,
  `[auth:upper]` expands the last name of the first author in uppercase.
