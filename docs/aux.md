# AUX Scanner

You can populate a reference collection from an existing paper by scanning the `aux` file generated by bibtex. AUX Scanning can be triggered from the `Tools` menu. The scanner will read your
AUX files and will put references you cited in the associated LaTeX
document into the current collection, and will add a note for references
cited in the LaTeX document but which do not exist in your Zotero
library. Note that the citation keys must be present in your library
before the scan is started -- BBT will *not* create new references for
citekeys it doesn't already know about.
