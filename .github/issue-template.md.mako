${next(check)}. you have included the *actual output* you got from exporting the items you sent in the debug log, not simplified fictional output or a description of the output, and a sample (*not* a description) of how you want it to look instead, again based on the actual items you selected in the previous step.

Picking the right issue category is really important. Each category (${', '.join([f'`{t.name.replace("_", " ")}`' for t in templates])}) has different instructions for gathering the data necessary required to resolve the issue you are experiencing

% if template.name in ['Key_generation', 'Export']:
The error report is important; it gives me your current BBT settings and a copy of the problematic reference as a test case so I can best replicate your problem. Without it, I'm effectively blind.

% elif template.name in ['General_error']:
The error-report is important; it gives me your current BBT settings and a log of what Zotero was doing at the time of error. Without it, I'm effectively blind.

% elif template.name in ['Import']:
The error-report is important; it gives me your current BBT settings and a log of what Zotero was doing at the time of import. Without it, I'm effectively blind.
