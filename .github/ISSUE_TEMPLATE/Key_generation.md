<!--
*Please verify **all** of the below before submitting*:

1. you have picked the right category for the issue in the previous screen.
2. in the Zotero addons screen you can see that you have the latest release of BBT (https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest) and Zotero installed
3. you are posting a single bug or feature request
4. you have included a descriptive subject of the problem
5. you are available for follow-up questions and testing
6. you have included an error-report ID here generated by reproducing the problem, selecting the problematic reference(s), right-clicking, and submitting an BBT error report from that popup menu

Picking the right issue category is really important. Each category (`Export`, `General error`, `Import`, `Key generation`, `Question`) has different instructions for gathering the data necessary required to resolve the issue you are experiencing

The error report is important; it gives me your current BBT settings and a copy of the problematic reference as a test case so I can best replicate your problem. Without it, I'm effectively blind.
