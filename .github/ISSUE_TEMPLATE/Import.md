*Please verify **all** of the below before submitting*:

1. you have picked the right category for the issue in the previous screen.
2. You are on the latest release of Zotero
3. in the Zotero addons screen you can see that you have the latest release of BBT (https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest)
4. you are posting a single bug or feature request.
5. the issue has a subject that succinctly describes the problem or question.
6. you are available for follow-up questions and testing.
7. you have attached a copy of the BibTeX you were trying to import to this issue.
8. you have included an error-report ID here generated by restarting Zotero with debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled), reproducing your problem, and selecting "Report Better BibTeX error" from the help menu.

**I AM NOT KIDDING ABOUT THIS. *PLEASE* INCLUDE A DEBUG LOG. I WILL END UP ASKING FOR IT ANYWAY**

Picking the right issue category is really important. Each category (`Export`, `General error`, `Import`, `Key generation`, `Question`) has different instructions for gathering the data necessary required to resolve the issue you are experiencing

The error-report is important; it gives me your current BBT settings and a log of what Zotero was doing at the time of import. Without it, I'm effectively blind.
