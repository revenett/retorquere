<!--
*Please verify **all** of the below before submitting*:

1. you have picked the right category for the issue in the previous screen.
2. in the Zotero addons screen you can see that you have the latest release of BBT (https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest) and Zotero installed
3. you are posting a single bug or feature request
4. you have included a descriptive subject of the problem
5. you are available for follow-up questions and testing
6. you have included an error-report ID here generated by restarting Zotero with debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled), reproducing your problem, and selecting "Report Better BibTeX error" from the help menu

Picking the right issue category is really important. Each category (`Export`, `General error`, `Import`, `Key generation`, `Question`) has different instructions for gathering the data necessary required to resolve the issue you are experiencing

The error-report is important; it gives me your current BBT settings and a log of what Zotero was doing at the time of error. Without it, I'm effectively blind.
