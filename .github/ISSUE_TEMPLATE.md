Alongside a description of your problem/question/feature suggestion, please also include a support log ID.

You can generate a support log ID by:
1. reproducing the problem
2. selecting the problematic reference(s)
3. right-clicking them
4. choose `BBT support log` from the popup menu.

If you are sure your question does not relate to items in your library at all, just select any one item in your library.


Thank you.
