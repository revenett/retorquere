    because getAsync isn't "same as get but asynchronously" but "sort
    of same as get but asynchronously, however if the object was not
    already loaded by some user interaction you're out of luck". BTW,
    if you could know at this point that getAsync would get you a loaded
    object, you could just have called "get". Nice.
